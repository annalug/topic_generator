SYSTEM droning Flight Information mingled with thesounds of urgent SHOUTS, running FEET, EXCLAMATIONS.YOUNG COLES POV:  twenty yards away, a BLONDE MAN is sprawled onthe floor, blood oozing from his gaudy Hawaiian shirt.A BRUNETTE in a tight dress, her face obscured from YOUNG COLESview, rushes to the injured man, kneels beside him, ministeringto his wound.ANGLE ON YOUNG COLE, flanked by his PARENTS, their faces out ofview, as they steer him away.FATHERS VOICE (o.s.)Come on, Son --this is no place for us.YOUNG COLE resists momentarily, mesmerized by the drama.YOUNG COLES POV:  intermittently visible through a confusion ofFIGURES rushing through the foreground, the BLONDE MAN reachingup and touching the cheek of the kneeling BRUNETTE in a gestureof enormous tenderness, a gesture of farewell, while the P.A.SYSTEM continues its monotonous monotone...P.A.

SYSTEM--number 5429, Garcia -- number 87645, Cole...COLE, late thirties, dark hair, comes awake in a bunk cage, oneof many stacked four high along both sides of a long dimcorridor.  He blinks in the near dark, shaken, disoriented.Then, as he \"recovers\" from his very vivid dream, WE GET OURFIRST LOOK AT HIS ENVIRONMENT...A WINDOWLESS UNDERGROUND WORLD OFETERNAL NIGHT SOMETIME IN THE FUTURE...AN ALMOST COLORLESS\"REALITY\" OF BLURRED EDGES AND ECHOEY SOUNDS, MUCH MORE\"DREAMLIKE\" THAN HIS DREAM.Flashlights glare. In the half-light, COLE sees spooky figures,GUARDS, moving among the locked bunk/cages.COLE turns and whispers to the occupant of the next cage, JOSE...COLESsssst!  Jose, whats going on?JOSEs face is almost lost in shadow.  What there is of it isyouthful.  Hes just a scared Puerto Rican kid!JOSE\"Volunteers\" again.JOSE immediately rolls over and feigns sleep as SCARFACE, amenacing guard with a jagged scar running down his cheek, loomsclose to COLEs cage and unlocks it.SCARFACE\"Volunteer duty\".    The PRISONERS in the other cages watch silently with narrowed eyes.COLEI didnt volunteer.SCARFACEYou causing trouble again?COLE(controls his temper)No trouble.INT.  EQUIPMENT ROOM - ETERNAL NIGHTCOLEs alone, struggling to get into what looks like a space suitin a room where suits hang like ghosts with blank eyes.TITLES BEGIN SUPERED OVER THE SCENECOLE has the torso of the suit on now and is trying to close it.OFFSCREEN VOICE (o.s.)All openings must be closed.COLE looks for the source of the voice, a tiny grate in the wall.OFFSCREEN VOICE (o.s.)If the integrity of the suit is compromisedin any way, if the fabric is torn or a zippernot closed, readmittance will be denied.INT.  SEALED CHAMBER - MINUTES LATER (ETERNAL NIGHT)COLE, wearing the \"space suit\" and a helmet with a plastic visor,steps into a tiny chamber, a kind of air lock.  The heavy doorclangs shut behind him.  Hes alone.  COLES breath comes quickernow as he sucks oxygen from the air tanks on his back.On the opposite wall is another door with a huge wheel lock.COLE turns the heavy wheel, opens the door, steps through ItINT.  ELEVATOR - SECONDS LATER (ETERNAL NIGHT)COLES in an ascending elevator that groans and creaks.  He looksdown at a crudely drawn map he holds in his gloved hand.The map shows a series of tunnels and ladders.INT.  SEWER PIPE - MINUTES LATER (NIGHT)COLE pans a flashlight, probing the filthy sewer hes wading throughRATS flee the blade of light, scurry across islands of rusting junk.The flashlight beam settles on a ladder mounted in the wall.Reaching the rusted ladder, COLE starts to climb awkwardly.EXT.  CITY STREET/FUTURE - MOMENTS LATER (NIGHT)A SCRAPING NOISE as a heavy man-hole cover is pushed up and movedaside.  COLES helmeted head emerges from below.COLES POV THROUGH HIS PLASTIC-VISORED HELMET:  a city inmoonlight!  A surreal image of abandoned buildings.  No peopleanywhere.  The only sounds are the WIND and COLES BREATHING.EXT.  ANOTHER CITY STREET - MINUTES LATER (NIGHT)COLES light reveals abandoned vine-covered automobiles.Moving to the nearest car, COLE searches in the vines forsomething.  Finds it.  An insect.COLE takes the bug in his gloved hand.  As he clumsily inserts itinto a collection tube, something makes him turn.Theres something across the street in the dark.  Something alive.COLE points his flashlight and reveals...a BEAR!  Startled by thelight, the animal blinks, then stands on its rear legs and ROARS.ANGLE ON COLE, staring wide-eyed.Then, the BEAR sinks down onto all fours and, trying to avoid theflashlight, it pads quickly down the street.INT.  SUBTERRANEAN PARKING GARAGE - NIGHTUsing the flashlight to see, COLE reaches down to the crackedfloor and gets another specimen.  DOGSHIT!The only sound is COLES labored BREATHING.Then, a different SOUND.  GRRRR!  A dog.  More GRRRRS.  Moredogs.  Then, a YIP.  Then, VICIOUS GROWLS.  Its a DOGFIGHT!EXT.  STREET - NIGHT (FIRST LIGHT)A giant OWL, perched on an overhead traffic light, raises its wingsand lifts off...rising higher and higher into the brightening sky.Below, on the street, COLE trudges along, passing desertedbuildings, windows broken, rusted signs dangling.INT.  DEPARTMENT STORE - NIGHT (FIRST LIGHT)COLES light reveals a spider web just inside the store.  A largeSPIDER tries to hide from the light.COLE reaches carefully into the web and plucks the spider andputs it into one of his specimen tubes.Then, he shines his light all around the once elegant store.  Theresnothing but aisle after aisle of moldering consumer goods.EXT.  DEPARTMENT STORE - DAWNAs COLE comes out of the store, the first rays of the sun hit thebuilding.  COLE stops, squints into the light through his visor.COLES POV:  spray-painted on the wall a long time ago is a stenciledlogo of twelve monkeys holding hands in a circle.  Over it iswritten, \"WE DID IT!\"COLE looks up.COLES POV:  high up on a building across the street, a LIONpatrols a ledge, pauses, looks out majestically over his world.TTTLES ENDINT.  FIRST UNDERGROUND DECONTAMINATION CHAMBER - ETERNAL NIGHTROARING WATER, powerful torrents gushing from nozzles in thewall, pummel the still-suited COLE.INT.  SECOND UNDERGROUND DECONTAMINATION CHAMBER - ETERNAL NIGHTStark naked and shivering, COLE is being scrubbed with brushes onlong poles (like the ones used to wash cars) wielded by two HULKINGFIGURES in bulky decontamination suits, their personas lost in theirwindowed masks.  Its a grim scene in a grim cement room with damp,dripping walls.  From an unseen source comes an AMPLIFIED VOICE,AMPLIFIED VOICE (o.s.)Raise your arms above your head.COLE lifts his arms and the FIGURES start scrubbing his armpits.INT.  TINY CHAMBER - SHORTLY (ETERNAL NIGHT)Still naked, COLE is seated on a stool while a MASKED TECHNICIANin a less elaborate, less bulky decontamination outfit drawsblood from COLES arm with an old-fashioned hypodermic needle.COLE glances toward a single, nearly opaque \"window\" of thickplastic in the rusty iron wall.  VAGUE FIGURES seem to lurkbehind the translucent aperture, studying him.The TECHNICIAN slips the blood sample through a slot in the wall.INT.  ENGINEERING OFFICE/FUTURE WORLD - ETERNAL NIGHTUshered in by two guards, TINY and SCARFACE, COLE looks around.COLES POV:  wails hidden by old headlines, articles, maps, charts...a blackboard covered with elaborate, sophisticated formulae...surfacesheaped with cracked monitors, gerry-rigged computers held together withstring, lasers lost in tangles of cable, ancient tube amplifiers, adilapidated cardboard reconstruction of a city, stacks of molderingbooks and tattered computer printouts...and, seated at a long conferencetable, staring at COLE, six SCIENTISTS:  an ASTROPHYSICIST, ENGINEER,BOTANIST, MICROBIOLOGIST, ZOOLOGIST, and a GEOLOGIST.  They representa \"modern\" science where brilliant new ideas interface with crude,outdated, patched-together technologies.TINYJames Cole.  Cleared from quarantine.MICROBIOLOGISTThank you.  You two wait outside.SCARFACEHes got a history, Doctor.  Violence.COLES eyes return to the walls.Headlines:  \"CLOCK TICKING!  NO CURE YET!\"SCARFACEAnti-social six -- doing 25 to life.ENGINEERI dont think hes going to hurt us.  Yourenot going to hurt us, are you Mr. Cole?COLES head turns quickly to the ENGINEER.COLENo, sir.The GUARDS exchange a look, shrug, exit, closing the door.MICROBIOLOGISTWhy dont you sit down, Mr. Cole.COLE goes to the empty chair at the conference table, sits down.ASTROPHYSICISTWe want you to tell us about lastnight.COLEI went to the surface and I collectedspecimens like I was told.The SCIENTISTS dont say anything.  They just study him carefully.COLE(worried)I mashed the spider, didnt I?MICROBIOLOGISTWell get to the spider later, Mr.Cole.  Right now, we want to knoweverything that you saw.INT.  ENGINEERING OFFICE - AN HOUR LATER (ETERNAL NIGHT)COLE, starting to look very tired now, stands at the blackboardsketching a detailed map of exactly where he was last night.ASTPOPHYSICISTWhere you collected sample #4, whatstreet was that?COLEUh...BOTANISTIts important to observe everything.COLEI think it was...Im sure it was 2nd Street.As the SCIENTISTS start to whisper animatedly among themselves,COLES eyes drift across the newspaper clippings taped to thewall.  One headline screams, \"VIRUS MUTATING!\"  Another featuresa photo of an OLD MAN (DR. MASON, who well see again later on)and the words, SCIENTIST SAYS, \"ITS TOO LATE FOR CURE\".ASTROPHYSICISTS VOICE (o.s.)Close your eyes, Cole.Startled, COLE closes his eyes obediently.BLACKNESS.  Like COLE, WE SEE NOTHING.  But we HEAR their VOICES.ENGINEERS VOICE (o.s.)Tell us in detail what youve seen inthis room.COLES VOICE (o.s.)Uh, in this room?  Uh...MICROBIOLOGISTS VOICE (o.s.)How many of us are there?COLES VOICE (o.s.)Six...seven, if you count me.ASTROPHYSICISTS VOICE (o.s.)Tell us about the pictures on the wall...COLES VOICE (o.s.)Uh, you mean the newspapers?A MONTAGE OF OVERLAPPING VOICES (o.s.)Tell us about the newspapers.  Can youhear my voice?  What do I look like?What does he look like, the man whojust spoke?  How old were you when youleft the surface?The VOICES blur into a cacophony and FADE INTO the droning P.A.SYSTEM at the airport.INT.  CONCOURSE/AIRPORT - DAYTHE DREAM AGAIN!  But at an earlier moment.  YOUNG COLE, flankedby his PARENTS, whose faces are out of view, is watching a PLANEland through one of the big glass windows that lines the concourseleading to the departure gates.P.A. SYSTEM (o.s.)Flight 784 now boarding at gate...Suddenly, a SHOUT, followed by raised VOICES, interrupts themonotonous airport routine.  As YOUNG COLE and his PARENTS turnto see whats going on, a man well call MR. PONYTAIL, his faceaverted, hurries past them, bumping YOUNG COLE with a ChicagoHulls Sports Duffle Bag.MR. PONYTAILWATCH IT!YOUNG COLE sees little more than the gaudy pants, the duffle, andthe mans ponytail flopping as he rushes towards the gates.Just then, a WOMANS VOICE cries out, \"NOOOOOOOOO!\"YOUNG COLE turns back toward the Security Check Point just asTRAVELERS scatter madly, some diving to the floor, othersrunning.  A TERRIFIED TRAVELER, hitting the floor close by, looksup at YOUNG COLE with panicky eyes, and asks....TERRIFIED TRAVELERJust exactly why did you volunteer?INT.  ENGINEERING OFFICE/FUTURE WORLD - (ETERNAL NIGHT)COLE comes abruptly awake.  Seated now, hes facing the SCIENTISTS.ASTROPHYSICISTWake up, Cole.COLEUh, I didnt hear the...MICROBIOLOGIST(tapping a pencil on the table)I asked you, why did you volunteer?COLEWell, the guard woke me up.  He told meI volunteered.The SCIENTISTS react, whispering urgently among themselves.COLE starts to nod off again, then comes awake with a start asthe ENGINEER speaks to him.ENGINEERWe appreciate you volunteering.  Yourea very good observer, Cole.COLEUh, thank you.ENGINEERYoull get a reduction in sentence.COLE keeps his face impassive.ASTROPHYSICISTTo be determined by the proper authorities.ENGINEERYou dont want to jeopardize that reduction,do you, Cole?  Have it taken away?COLENo, sir!ASTROPHYSICISTWe have a very advanced program, somethingvery different, requires very skilled people.MICROBIOLOGISTAn opportunity to reduce your sentenceconsiderably...ZOOLOGISTAnd possibly play an important role inreturning the human race to the surfaceof the earth.ENGINEERWe want tough minded people.  Strongmentally.  Weve had some...misfortuneswith \"unstable\" types.ASTROPHYSICISTFor a man in your position...an opportunity.BOTANISTNot to volunteer could be a real mistake.MICROBIOLOGIST(tapping his pencil again)Definitely a mistake!COLE gives away nothing.  Hes in a box here.  He has no choices.He stares at the tapping pencil.INT.  ART GALLERY - NIGHTA strikingly \"real\" world of bright colors.  Extravagant paintingsadorn the walls.  A POET, tiny and ruddy faced, squints over hisglasses as he reads in a booming voice to an AUDIENCE of thirtyseated on folding chairs.POETStill among the myriad microwaves, theinfra-red messages, the gigabytes of onesand zeroes, we find words, infinitesimallysmall, byte-sized now, tinier even thanscience lurking in some vague electricitywhere, if we listen we can hear the solitaryvoice of that poet telling us,\"We are no other than a moving rowOf Magic shadow-shapes that come and goRound with the Sun-illumined Lantern holdIn Midnight by the Master of the show.\"As the POET reads, we STUDY the audience, mostly YUPPIE CULTUREJUNKIES or BOHEMIANS.  Among them, a light-haired woman of twenty-eight, soberly dressed, wearing glasses.  Shes KATHRYN RAILLY.  Andits her beeper that suddenly BEEPS.  BEEP!  BEEP!POETS VOICE (o.s.)\"The Moving Finger writes; and, having writ,Moves on:  nor all your Piety nor WitShall lure it back to cancel half a Line,Nor all your Tears wash out a Word of it.\"BEEP!  BEEP!  Scowling at the outrageous interruption, the POETlooks up from the text just as RAILLY, tumbling, shuts off thebeeper and rises, embarrassed.  As she makes her way to an exit,the glaring POET continues...POET\"Yesterday This Days Madness did prepare;Tomorrows Silence, Triumph or Despair:Drink!  for you know not whence you came, nor why:Drink!  for you know not why you go, nor where.\"INT.  CORRIDOR/POLICE STATION - NIGHTDETECTIVE FRANKI leads RAILLY past crowded holding cells.FRANKI-- so they get there and they ask the guyreal nice for some kind of i.d., and he getsagitated, starts screaming about viruses.Totally irrational, totally disoriented,doesnt know where he is, what day it is,alla that stuff.  All they got was hisname.  They figure hes stoned out ofhis mind, its some kinda psychoticepisode, so theyre gonna bring him...RAILLYHes been tested for drugs?FRANKINegative for drugs.  But he took onfive cops like he was dusted to theeyeballs.  No drugs.  You believe that?FRANKI pauses, indicating a tiny observation window of thick meshedglass in an otherwise solid door, and RAILLY looks through it.RAILLYS POV THROUGH THE WINDOW:  a MAN, his back to her, instrait-jacket and prison denims, examining the wall of the paddedcell with the distorted intensity of a \"mental case\".RAILLYYou have him in restraints.FRANKIWere you listening?  We got two officers inthe hospital.  Yeah, hes in restraints, plusthe medic gave him enough stellazine to killa horse.  Look at him!  Still on his feet.RAILLYS POV THROUGH THE WINDOW:  the MAN in the cell turns, looksright at her.  In spite of the cuts and welts, its clearly COLE.RAILLYThat would explain the bruises, Iguess.  The struggle.FRANKIYou want to go in?  Examine him?RAILLYYes, please.  You said he gave a name...FRANKI(unlocking the door)James Cole.  Thats everything we got.  Noneof the James Coles on the computer match him.No license, no prints, no warrants.  Nothing.You want me to go in with you?RAILLY(entering)No, thank you.FRANKIIll be right here...just in case.INT.  ISOLATION CELLCOLE stares at RAILLY.  The environment is intensely real...vividcolors...each sound, however slight, very distinct, almost loud...and yet she appears to him almost like a vision.RAILLYMr. Cole?  My name is Doctor Railly.Im a psychiatrist.  I work for theCounty -- I dont work for the police.My only concern is your well being --do you understand that?COLEI need to go now.RAILLYIm going to be completely honest.  Imnot going to lie to you.  I cant makethe police let you go...but I do wantto help you.  And I want you to trustme.  Can you do that, James?  May Icall you \"James\"?COLE\"James\"!  Nobody ever calls me that.RAILLY(frowns, studies him)Have you been a patient at County?Have I seen you someplace?COLENo, not possible.  Listen, I have toget out of here.  Im supposed to begetting information.RAILLYWhat kind of information?COLEIt wont help you.  You cant do anythingabout it.

POLICE STATION CORRIDOR - MORNINGCOLE, bound tightly by the strait-jacket, heavy manacles on hisankles, is being escorted down the corridor by two surly POLICEMEN.COLEWhere are you taking me?POLICEMAN #1South of France, buddy.  Fancy hotel.Youre gonna love it.COLESouth of France?!  I dont want to goto the South of France.  I want to makea telephone call.POLICEMAN #2 smirks as he unlocks a heavy steel door.POLICEMAN #2Zip it, scumbag -- you fooled the shrinkwith your act, but you dont fool us.Then, POLICEMAN #2 swings the steel door open and sunlightoverwhelms COLE, blinding him in a dazzling fury of white light.EXT.  CITY STREET/MINI-VAN - DAYA Mini-van, the kind of vehicle used to transport a half dozenprisoners, crawls through a busy street.  The Police Departmentlogo is prominent on the side of the van beneath barred windows.INT. COUNTY HOSPITAL/SHOWERS - AN HOUR LATER (MORNING)Fierce spray recalls the decontamination in the future.  COLEstands stark naked under the shower while two muscular attendants,PALMER and BILLINGS, supervise.As PALMER shuts off the water, BILLINGS hands COLE a towel andstarts inspecting his scalp...BILLINGSLemme see your head, Jimbo, see if yougot any creepy crawlies.COLEI need to make a telephone call.BILLINGS(pulling Coles head)Gotta work that out with a doctor, Jimbo.Cant make no calls til the doctor says.COLEIts very important.BILLINGSWhat chew gotta do, Jimbo, is take iteasy, relax into things.  We all gonnaget along fine if you just relax.COLE gets the hint of menace in the message and submits to thelice inspection, only his eyes revealing his frustration.INT.  HOSPITAL/DAYROOM - HALF AN HOUR LATER (DAY)COLE stands in the doorway, stunned by his first sight of thelarge room.  His eyes go to the heavily-grilled windows wherelight pours in from outside.  Then, to the TV, where a CARTOONCOMMERCIAL makes raucous noises.PATIENTS, in K-Mart street clothes or ratty robes, stare gloomilyat the TV, or play cards, pace, or just stare blankly.BILLINGS is at COLES side, beckoning to a patient, JEFFREY MASON,a twenty year old white youth dressed in khakis and a plaid shirt.BILLINGSJeffrey.  Yo!  Jeffrey.  This here is James.Whyncha show James around?  Tell him the TVrules, show him the games an stuff, okay?JEFFREY(with a sly look)How much you gonna pay me?  Huh?  Idbe doing your job.BILLINGSFive thousand dollars, my man.  Thatenough?  Ill wire it to your accountas usual, okay?JEFFREYOkay, Billings.  Five thousand.  Thatsenough.  Five thousand dollars.  Illgive him the Deluxe Mental Hospital Tour.As BILLINGS walks away chuckling, JEFFREY turns to COLE.JEFFREYKid around, kid around.  It makes them feelgood, were all pals.  Were prisoners, theyrethe guards, but its all in good fun, you see?COLE nods and JEFFREY indicates card tables where PATIENTS areplaying cards, checkers, chess, or working on jig saw puzzles.JEFFREYHeres the games.  Games vegitize you.If you play the games, yourevoluntarily taking a tranquilizer.COLE sees a partially completed puzzle of the well-known painting,THE PEACEABLE KINGDOM, depicting a serene world of animals in harmony.JEFFREYWhatd they give you?  Thorazine?  Howmuch?  Learn your drugs -- know your doses.COLEI need to make a telephone call.JEFFREYA telephone call?  Thats communicationwith the outside world!  Doctorsdiscretion.  Hey, if alla these nutscould just make phone calls, it couldspread.  Insanity oozing through telephonecables, oozing into the ears of all thosepoor sane people, infecting them!  Whackoseverywhere!  A plague of madness.(suddenly sly and confidential)In fact, very few of us here are actuallymentally ill.  Im not saying yourenot mentally ill, for all I know yourecrazy as a loon.  But thats not whyyoure here.  Why youre here is becauseof the system, because of the economy.(indicating the TV)Theres the TV.  Its all right there.Commercials.  We are not productiveanymore, they dont need us to makethings anymore, its all automated.  Whatare we for then?  Were consumers.  Okay,buy a lot of stuff, youre a good citizen.But if you dont buy a lot of stuff, youknow what?  Youre mentally ill! Thatsa fact!  If you dont buy things...toiletpaper, new cars, computerized blenders,electrically operated sexual devices...(getting hysterical)SCREWDRIVERS WITH MINIATURE BUILT-INRADAR DEVICES, STEREO SYSTEMS WITHBRAIN IMPLANTED HEADPHONES, VOICE-ACTIVATED COMPUTERS, AND...A woman orderly, TERRY, turns from the feeble PATIENT shes helping.TERRYTake it easy, Jeffrey.  Be calm.Abruptly, JEFFREY stifles his hysteria, takes a deep breath andcontinues, completely calm now.  But COLE isnt listening.  Hesmesmerized by the TV.JEFFREYSo if you want to watch a particularprogram, say \"All My Children\" orsomething, you go to the Charge Nurseand tell her what day and time the showyou want to see is on.  But you have totell her before the show is scheduledto be on.  There was this one guy whowas always requesting shows that had alreadyplayed.  He couldnt quite grasp theidea that the Charge Nurse couldntjust make it be yesterday for him, turnback time ha ha.  What a fruitcake!!This last thought actually penetrates COLES focus on the TV andhe turns to JEFFREY whos picking up speed again.JEFFREYSeriously, more and more people arebeing defined now as mentally ill.  Why?Because theyre not consuming on theirown.  But as patients, they beconeconsumers of mental health care.  Andthis gives the so-called sane people work!(hysteria again)WHOOO!  SHOCK THERAPY!  GROUP THERAPY!HALLUCINATIONS!  THERAPEUTIC DRUGS!IGGIDY DIGGIDY DIG!  PERFECT!  THESYSTEM IN HARMONY LIKE A BIG MACHINE...TERRYOkay, thats it, Jeffrey, youre gonnaget a shot.  I warned you...JEFFREY(calming himself, smiling)Right!  Right!  Carried away, heh heh.I got \"carried away\".  Explaining theworkings of...the institution.Just then, TJ WASHINGTON, a somber-looking African American in abathrobe, taps COLE on the shoulder.TJ WASHINGTONI dont really come from outer space.JEFFREYThis is TJ Washington, Jim -- hedoesnt really come from outer space.TJ WASHINGTONDont mock me, my friend.(to Cole)Its a condition of \"mental divergence\".I find myself on another planet, Ogo,part of an intellectual elite, preparingto subjugate barbarian hordes on Pluto.But even though its a totally convincingreality in every way...I can feel, breathe,hear...nevertheless, Ogo is actually aconstruct of my psyche.  I am mentallydivergent in that I am escaping certainunnamed realities that plague my lifehere.  When I stop going there, I willbe well.  Are you also divergent, friend?The P.A. SYSTEM interrupts, startling COLE.P.A. SYSTEM (v.o.)James Cole.  Report to Staff.  James Cole!JEFFREYStaff!  Whoo!  Time for Staff.  Now thegeniuses cure you.  Hallelujah!INT.  PSYCH WARD CONFERENCE ROOM - MINUTES LATER (DAY)COLE is agitated, speaking forcefully.COLEThis is a place for crazy people!

Theres beena mistake, Ive been sent to the wrong place.Suddenly, COLE reaches out and BILLINGS lunges forward, but COLEis just grabbing a pad and pencil.COLEHey, Im not going to hurt anybody.FLETCHER restrains BILLINGS with a hand signal.COLE(drawing)Do any of you know anything about theArmy of the Twelve Monkeys?  They paintthis, stencil it, on buildings, allover the place.COLE waves a sketch of the dancing monkey logo we saw earlier.DR. CASEYMr. Cole...COLERight.  I guess you wouldnt, this is1989, theyre probably not active yet.That makes sense!  Okay.  Listen to me,three billion people died in 1995.Three billion, got that?  Almostthe whole population.  Of the world!Only about one percent survived.DOCTORS exchange knowing looks.  This is an old story, apparently.RESIDENT #2Are you going to save us, Mr. Cole?COLESave you?  How can I save you?  Italready happened!  I cant save you.  Imsimply trying to get some information forpeople in the present so that someday...(sees their eyes)You dont believe me.  You think Imcrazy.  But Im not crazy.  Im a convict,sure, I have a quick temper, but Im assane as anyone in this room.  I...COLE stops, sees DR. FLETCHER tapping his pencil.  COLES seenthat tapping before -- in the future!  It disorients him.DR. RAILLYCan you tell us the name of the prisonyouve come from?COLE doesnt answer.  Hes staring at the tapping pencil.DR. FLETCHERDoes this bother you, Mr. Cole?COLE(recovering, new tack)No!  Look, I dont belong here!  What Ineed to do is make a telephone call tostraighten everything out.DR. FLETCHERWho would you call, Mr. Cole, who wouldstraighten everything out?COLEScientists.  Im supposed to report into them.  Theyll want to know theysent me to the wrong time.DR. FLETCHERSo you could talk to these scientistsand they do what?  Send you to the future?COLENo, no.  I cant talk to them.  Its called,\"voice mail\".  Im supposed to leave messages.They monitor it from the present.RESIDENT #2\"From the present.\"  Were not in thepresent now, Mr. Cole?COLENo, no.  This is the past.  This hasalready happened.  Listen...RESIDENT #3Mr. Cole, you belong in 1995 -- thatsthe present, is that it?COLENo, 1995 is the past, too.  Look...DR. FLETCHERThese scientists, Mr. Cole?  Are theydoctors like ourselves?Two of the residents exchange quick knowing looks.COLENo!  I mean yes, but... Look, Ive been givena lot of drugs but Im still perfectly lucid.You have to let me use the phone.  One call!COLE looks desperately toward RAILLY, pleading eyes meeting hers.INT.  LOW RENT APARTMENT - DAYFour little KIDS SCREAM and SQUABBLE while the phone CHIRPSinsistently in the tiny, cluttered apartment and a harried MOTHERlunges for the phone, answers sharply...MOTHERYes?(listens, frowns, then)Whaaaaat?  \"Voice mail\"!  I dont knowwhat youre talkin about. ... Is thisa joke?  I dont know any scientists.James who?  Never heard of you!The MOTHER slams down the phone.INT.  RAILLYS OFFICE/COUNTY HOSPITAL - DAYA dismayed COLE still has the receiver in his hand.  Sympathetically,RAILLY takes it from him.RAILLYIt wasnt who you expected?COLE is clearly agitated, starts to pace, upset.  Nuts?COLEIt was some lady.  She didnt know anything.RAILLYPerhaps it was a wrong number...COLENo.  Thats the reason they chose me --I remember things.RAILLY frowns, studying the distracted man with intense interest.Its clear COLE is becoming a special patient and RAILLYS cool,detached demeanor is giving way ever so slightly.RAILLYJames, where did you grow up?  Was itaround here?  Around Baltimore?COLE(lost in thought)What?RAILLYI have the...strangest feeling Ive metyou before...a long time ago, perhaps.Were you ever...?COLEWait!  This is only 1989!  Im supposedto be leaving messages in 1995.  Itsnot the right number yet.  Thats theproblem.  Damn!  How can I contact them?RAILLY recovers her distance, her poise, as she takes a bottle,pours out some tablets, and holds them out to COLE.RAILLYJames, take these.(watching him step back)Please -- I helped you like I said Iwould.  Now I want you to trust me.INT.  AIRPORT CONCOURSE - DAY (THE DREAM)MR. PONYTAIL races past the startled YOUNG COLE.MR. PONYTAILWATCH IT!Was it JEFFREY wearing gaudy pants and a ponytail?  It wasdefinitely JEFFREYS VOICE.TRAVELERS dive for cover as a WOMANS VOICE cries out...WOMANS VOICENOOOOOOOOOO!The TERRIFIED TRAVELER looks up at YOUNG COLE, makes eye contact, butdoesnt speak.  The TERRIFIED TRAVELER looks a lot like DR. FLETCHER!Just then, YOUNG COLE is distracted by a running figure.  Itsthe BLONDE MAN in the Hawaiian shirt, but hes not injured.

DORMITORY (PSYCH WARD)/COUNTY HOSPITAL - NIGHTCOLES eyes blink awake, blinded by a flashlight.Hes lying in one of thirty beds in a darkened ward.  Disoriented.Which world is this?  The room is full of BREATHING, SNORING,occasional MOANS.  He can barely discern the shadowy figures ofan ORDERLY and a NURSE, making their rounds, checking each bed.His eyes adjusting to the darkness, COLE watches them exit.He turns and sees a patch of moonlight coming in a barred window.With a quick glance at the sleeping PATIENTS, he slips out ofbed, makes his way stealthily to the window, peers out.COLES POV:  the moon, glowing in the sky, illuminating a singletree.  Under the tree, in silhouette, a COUPLE embraces, kisses.ANGLE ON COLE, looking out the window, absorbed.VOICE (o.s.)It wont work.

And all the doors arelocked, too.  Theyre protecting thepeople on the outside from us.  But thepeople outside are as crazy as us.COLE has become preoccupied with a small SPIDER creeping alongthe window sill.  Hes staring at it when hes distracted by asudden SOUND.  Grabbing the SPIDER, COLE scrambles back into bedjust as the door opens and an ORDERLY probes the dark room withthe blade of his flashlight.ANGLE ON COLE, in bed, feigning sleep.The flashlight clicks off and COLE hears the door close.For a long moment the ward is silent except for BREATHING,SNORES, occasional MOANS.  Then, COLE hears JEFFREYS hoarsewhisper, picking up right where he left off.JEFFREYYou know what \"crazy\" is?  \"crazy\" is\"majority rules\".  Take germs for example.Although COLE is preoccupied with the SPIDER struggling to getout of his fist, he cant help reacting to the word, \"germs\"!COLEGerms?!JEFFREYIn the 18th century there was no suchthing!  Nobodyd ever imagined such athing -- no sane person anyway.  Alongcomes this doctor...Semmelweiss, Ithink.  He tries to convince people...other doctors mostly...that there arethese teeny tiny invisible \"bad things\"called germs that get into your body andmake you...sick!  Hes trying to getdoctors to wash their hands.  What isthis guy...crazy?

Hegoes, \"I dont believe in germs.  Germsare just a plot they made up so theycan sell you disinfectants and soap!\"Now, hes crazy, right?  Hey, youbelieve in germs, dont you?COLEIm not crazy.JEFFREYOf course not, I never thought you were.You want to escape, right?  Thats verysane.  I can help you.  You want me to,dont you?

COLLEGE CAMPUS - NIGHTStunningly quiet.  We are on a placid campus looking at thedignified architecture of Breitrose Hall.

KATHRYN RAILLYMADNESS AND APOCALYPTIC VISIONSMAY 17INT.  AUDITORIUM/BREITROSE HALL - NIGHTA large screen dominates the auditorium stage.  On the screen isa slide of an engraving from the Middle Ages showing a MADMAN inapparent agony, his mouth shaped to a scream, as he is restrainedby PEASANTS.  The projector ZOOMS slowly in on the agonized FACEof this MADMAN as we HEAR RAILLYS VOICE lecturing.RAILLYS VOICE (o.s.)According to the accounts of localofficials at that time, this gentleman,judged to be about forty years of age,appeared suddenly in the village of Wylenear Stonehenge in the West of England inApril of 1162.  Using unfamiliar words andspeaking in a strange accent, the man madedire prognostications about a pestilencewhich he predicted would wipe out humanityin approximately 8OO years.  Deranged andhysterical, the man raped a young woman of thevillage, was taken into custody, but thenmysteriously escaped and was not heard of again.WE DISCOVER RAILLY, six years older now, standing at a lecternin a pool of light.  Shes dwarfed by the giant screen where theengraving is replaced by a series of slides of woodcuts showingscenes of pestilence in the Middle Ages as she lectures to anaudience of mostly SCHOLARLY TYPES.RAILLY (cont.)In 1841, Mackay wrote, \"During seasonsof great pestilence, men have oftenbelieved the prophecies of crazedfanatics, that the end of the world wascome.\"  Obviously, this plague/doomsdayscenario is considerably more compellingwhen reality supports it in some form,whether its the Bubonic Plague, smallpox,or AIDS.  In addition to these \"natural\"contagions, there are now technologicalhorrors as well:  besides radiation,consider our lurking fear of germwarfare and its close approximation,chemical warfare, which first rearedits ugly head in the deadly mustardgas attacks during the First World War.ON THE SCREEN, a SERIES of SLIDES show images of WORLD WAR ISOLDIERS in gas masks, in death throes, etc..RAILLYS VOICE (cont. o.s.)During such an attack in the Frenchtrenches in October, 1917, we have anaccount of this soldier...ON THE SCREEN, a slide of an old deteriorated photograph showsJOSE, the Puerto Rican kid, strapped to a stretcher, being carriedby SOLDIERS through the trenches during an attack.  JOSE appearsto be ranting madly as the projector ZOOMS CLOSER on his face untilthe image approximates Munchs famous painting.RAILLYS VOICE (cant. o.s.)-- who, during an assault, was woundedby shrapnel and hospitalized behind thelines where Doctors discovered he hadlost all comprehension of French butspoke English fluently, albeit in aregional dialect they didnt recognize.The man, although physically unaffectedby the gas, was hysterical.  He claimedhe had come from the future, that he waslooking for a pure germ that wouldultimately wipe mankind off the face ofthe earth in the year... 1995!The AUDIENCE gives a nervous CHUCKLE.ON THE SCREEN, a different old photograph of JOSE.  This timehes in a military hospital, gaunt, haunted, very ill.RAILLYS VOICE (cont. o.s.)Although seriously injured, the youngsoldier disappeared from the hospitalbefore more data could be gathered.  Nodoubt, he was trying to carry on hismission to warn others, substitutingfor the agony of war...a self-inflictedagony we call the \"Cassandra Complex\".As RAILLY continues, we SCAN the AUDIENCE and DISCOVER MARILOU MARTIN,RAILLYS friend, and MARILOUS HUSBAND, WAYNE CHANG, both listeningattentively.  Further away, another MAN listens intently.  A MAN withshoulder-length carrot-colored hair.  His name is DR. PETERS.RAILLY (cont.)Cassandra, in Greek legend you will recall,was condemned to know the future but to bedisbelieved when she foretold it.  Hence,the agony of foreknowledge combined withimpotence to do anything about it.INT.  RECEPTION ROOM - AN HOUR LATER (NIGHT)A stack of new books.  THE DOOMSDAY SYNDROME, ApocalypticVisions of the Mentally Ill by Dr. Kathryn RaillySurrounded by enthusiastic members of the audience, RAILLY isseated at the table signing books but DR. PETERS has her ear.DR. PETERSI think, Dr. Railly, you have givenyour alarmists a bad name.  Surelythere is very real and very convincingdata that the planet cannot survive theexcesses of the human race:  proliferationof atomic devices, uncontrolled breedinghabits, the rape of the environment, thepollution of land, sea, and air.  In thiscontext, isnt it obvious that \"ChickenLittle\" represents the sane vision andthat Homo Sapiens motto, \"Lets goshopping!\" is the cry of the true lunatic?DR. PETERS smiles self-importantly at RAILLY as an elderlydisheveled PROFESSOR elbows in front of him. DISHEVELED PROFESSORDoctor Railly -- please!  I wonder ifyoure aware of my own studies whichindicate that certain cycles of themoon actually impact on the incidenceof apocalyptic predictions as observedin urban emergency rooms and...As the PROFESSOR babbles, MARILOU MARTIN and her husband, WAYNECHANG, appear and whisper...MARILOUYou were great.RAILLYYoure leaving?MARILOUThe reservations at nine thirty --its getting late.DISHEVELED PROFESSORDoctor Railly -- please -- this is veryimportant!WAYNE CHANG(checking the professor)You sure youre gonna be all right?RAILLY(smiles, checks her watch)Ill be there in twenty minutes.DISHEVELED PROFESSORDr. Railly, I simply cannot understandyour exclusion of the moon in relationto apocalyptic dementia...EXT.

His face is lost in darknessbut she glimpses ragged, torn clothing as he tries to read themap by the intermittent glow of passing street lights.RAILLYWhere... where are we goingMANI need you to drive me to Philadelphia.RAILLY(startled, horrified)But thats... thats more than 200 miles!MANThats why I cant walk there.  Turnhere... I think...RAILLY obeys.  She glances in the mirror again, hesitates, thenboldly switches on the dome light, holding her breath fearfullyfor his reaction.He grunts appreciatively.  Relieved, she looks in the mirroragain, trying to get a better look at him, but now his featuresare concealed by the map.RAILLYIf you make me go with you, itskidnapping.  Thats a serious crime.If you let me go, you could just takethe car and...MANI dont know how to drive!  We wentunderground when I was nine, I told youthat.

Sorry about that.But then I saw your book in a store windowwith a notice about your lecture.(sudden pride)I can read, remember?RAILLYYes, I remember.(a beat, then)Why do you want to go to Philadelphia?COLEIts the next step.  I checked out theBaltimore information, it was nothing.Its Philadelphia, thats where theyare, the ones who killed everyone.(pointing suddenly, eagerly)Zs that a radio?  Does it play music?RAILLY turns on the radio and immediately WE HEAR the SOUND of SURFand the CRIES of gulls, background to an oozing baritone COMMERCIAL.COMMERCIAL/RADIO (o.s.)This is a personal message to you.COLE sits up, alert, listening intently.COMMERCIAL/RADIO (cont. o.s.)Are you at the end of your rope?  Areyou dying to get away?COLES eyes narrow, concentrating on this personal message.COMMERCAIL/RADIO (cont. o.s.}The Florida Keys are waiting for you.COLE frowns as the SOUND of breaking SURF and crying GULLS fillsthe car.

He blinks in the near dark, shaken, disoriented.Then, as he \"recovers\" from his very vivid dream, WE GET OURFIRST LOOK AT HIS ENVIRONMENT...A WINDOWLESS UNDERGROUND WORLD OFETERNAL NIGHT SOMETIME IN THE FUTURE...AN ALMOST COLORLESS\"REALITY\" OF BLURRED EDGES AND ECHOEY SOUNDS, MUCH MORE\"DREAMLIKE\" THAN HIS DREAM.Flashlights glare. In the half-light, COLE sees spooky figures,GUARDS, moving among the locked bunk/cages.COLE turns and whispers to the occupant of the next cage, JOSE...COLESsssst!  Jose, whats going on?JOSEs face is almost lost in shadow.  What there is of it isyouthful.  Hes just a scared Puerto Rican kid!JOSE\"Volunteers\" again.JOSE immediately rolls over and feigns sleep as SCARFACE, amenacing guard with a jagged scar running down his cheek, loomsclose to COLEs cage and unlocks it.SCARFACE\"Volunteer duty\".    The PRISONERS in the other cages watch silently with narrowed eyes.COLEI didnt volunteer.SCARFACEYou causing trouble again?COLE(controls his temper)No trouble.INT.

SEALED CHAMBER - MINUTES LATER (ETERNAL NIGHT)COLE, wearing the \"space suit\" and a helmet with a plastic visor,steps into a tiny chamber, a kind of air lock.  The heavy doorclangs shut behind him.  Hes alone.  COLES breath comes quickernow as he sucks oxygen from the air tanks on his back.On the opposite wall is another door with a huge wheel lock.COLE turns the heavy wheel, opens the door, steps through ItINT.  ELEVATOR - SECONDS LATER (ETERNAL NIGHT)COLES in an ascending elevator that groans and creaks.  He looksdown at a crudely drawn map he holds in his gloved hand.The map shows a series of tunnels and ladders.INT.  SEWER PIPE - MINUTES LATER (NIGHT)COLE pans a flashlight, probing the filthy sewer hes wading throughRATS flee the blade of light, scurry across islands of rusting junk.The flashlight beam settles on a ladder mounted in the wall.Reaching the rusted ladder, COLE starts to climb awkwardly.EXT.  CITY STREET/FUTURE - MOMENTS LATER (NIGHT)A SCRAPING NOISE as a heavy man-hole cover is pushed up and movedaside.  COLES helmeted head emerges from below.COLES POV THROUGH HIS PLASTIC-VISORED HELMET:  a city inmoonlight!  A surreal image of abandoned buildings.  No peopleanywhere.  The only sounds are the WIND and COLES BREATHING.EXT.  ANOTHER CITY STREET - MINUTES LATER (NIGHT)COLES light reveals abandoned vine-covered automobiles.Moving to the nearest car, COLE searches in the vines forsomething.  Finds it.  An insect.COLE takes the bug in his gloved hand.  As he clumsily inserts itinto a collection tube, something makes him turn.Theres something across the street in the dark.  Something alive.COLE points his flashlight and reveals...a BEAR!  Startled by thelight, the animal blinks, then stands on its rear legs and ROARS.ANGLE ON COLE, staring wide-eyed.Then, the BEAR sinks down onto all fours and, trying to avoid theflashlight, it pads quickly down the street.INT.  SUBTERRANEAN PARKING GARAGE - NIGHTUsing the flashlight to see, COLE reaches down to the crackedfloor and gets another specimen.  DOGSHIT!The only sound is COLES labored BREATHING.Then, a different SOUND.  GRRRR!  A dog.  More GRRRRS.  Moredogs.  Then, a YIP.  Then, VICIOUS GROWLS.  Its a DOGFIGHT!EXT.  STREET - NIGHT (FIRST LIGHT)A giant OWL, perched on an overhead traffic light, raises its wingsand lifts off...rising higher and higher into the brightening sky.Below, on the street, COLE trudges along, passing desertedbuildings, windows broken, rusted signs dangling.INT.  DEPARTMENT STORE - NIGHT (FIRST LIGHT)COLES light reveals a spider web just inside the store.  A largeSPIDER tries to hide from the light.COLE reaches carefully into the web and plucks the spider andputs it into one of his specimen tubes.Then, he shines his light all around the once elegant store.  Theresnothing but aisle after aisle of moldering consumer goods.EXT.  DEPARTMENT STORE - DAWNAs COLE comes out of the store, the first rays of the sun hit thebuilding.  COLE stops, squints into the light through his visor.COLES POV:  spray-painted on the wall a long time ago is a stenciledlogo of twelve monkeys holding hands in a circle.  Over it iswritten, \"WE DID IT!\"COLE looks up.COLES POV:  high up on a building across the street, a LIONpatrols a ledge, pauses, looks out majestically over his world.TTTLES ENDINT.  FIRST UNDERGROUND DECONTAMINATION CHAMBER - ETERNAL NIGHTROARING WATER, powerful torrents gushing from nozzles in thewall, pummel the still-suited COLE.INT.  SECOND UNDERGROUND DECONTAMINATION CHAMBER - ETERNAL NIGHTStark naked and shivering, COLE is being scrubbed with brushes onlong poles (like the ones used to wash cars) wielded by two HULKINGFIGURES in bulky decontamination suits, their personas lost in theirwindowed masks.  Its a grim scene in a grim cement room with damp,dripping walls.  From an unseen source comes an AMPLIFIED VOICE,AMPLIFIED VOICE (o.s.)Raise your arms above your head.COLE lifts his arms and the FIGURES start scrubbing his armpits.INT.  TINY CHAMBER - SHORTLY (ETERNAL NIGHT)Still naked, COLE is seated on a stool while a MASKED TECHNICIANin a less elaborate, less bulky decontamination outfit drawsblood from COLES arm with an old-fashioned hypodermic needle.COLE glances toward a single, nearly opaque \"window\" of thickplastic in the rusty iron wall.  VAGUE FIGURES seem to lurkbehind the translucent aperture, studying him.The TECHNICIAN slips the blood sample through a slot in the wall.INT.  ENGINEERING OFFICE/FUTURE WORLD - ETERNAL NIGHTUshered in by two guards, TINY and SCARFACE, COLE looks around.COLES POV:  wails hidden by old headlines, articles, maps, charts...a blackboard covered with elaborate, sophisticated formulae...surfacesheaped with cracked monitors, gerry-rigged computers held together withstring, lasers lost in tangles of cable, ancient tube amplifiers, adilapidated cardboard reconstruction of a city, stacks of molderingbooks and tattered computer printouts...and, seated at a long conferencetable, staring at COLE, six SCIENTISTS:  an ASTROPHYSICIST, ENGINEER,BOTANIST, MICROBIOLOGIST, ZOOLOGIST, and a GEOLOGIST.  They representa \"modern\" science where brilliant new ideas interface with crude,outdated, patched-together technologies.TINYJames Cole.  Cleared from quarantine.MICROBIOLOGISTThank you.

Yourenot going to hurt us, are you Mr. Cole?COLES head turns quickly to the ENGINEER.COLENo, sir.The GUARDS exchange a look, shrug, exit, closing the door.MICROBIOLOGISTWhy dont you sit down, Mr. Cole.COLE goes to the empty chair at the conference table, sits down.ASTROPHYSICISTWe want you to tell us about lastnight.COLEI went to the surface and I collectedspecimens like I was told.The SCIENTISTS dont say anything.  They just study him carefully.COLE(worried)I mashed the spider, didnt I?MICROBIOLOGISTWell get to the spider later, Mr.Cole.  Right now, we want to knoweverything that you saw.INT.  ENGINEERING OFFICE - AN HOUR LATER (ETERNAL NIGHT)COLE, starting to look very tired now, stands at the blackboardsketching a detailed map of exactly where he was last night.ASTPOPHYSICISTWhere you collected sample #4, whatstreet was that?COLEUh...BOTANISTIts important to observe everything.COLEI think it was...Im sure it was 2nd Street.As the SCIENTISTS start to whisper animatedly among themselves,COLES eyes drift across the newspaper clippings taped to thewall.  One headline screams, \"VIRUS MUTATING!\"  Another featuresa photo of an OLD MAN (DR.

SYSTEM (o.s.)Flight 784 now boarding at gate...Suddenly, a SHOUT, followed by raised VOICES, interrupts themonotonous airport routine.  As YOUNG COLE and his PARENTS turnto see whats going on, a man well call MR. PONYTAIL, his faceaverted, hurries past them, bumping YOUNG COLE with a ChicagoHulls Sports Duffle Bag.MR. PONYTAILWATCH IT!YOUNG COLE sees little more than the gaudy pants, the duffle, andthe mans ponytail flopping as he rushes towards the gates.Just then, a WOMANS VOICE cries out, \"NOOOOOOOOO!\"YOUNG COLE turns back toward the Security Check Point just asTRAVELERS scatter madly, some diving to the floor, othersrunning.  A TERRIFIED TRAVELER, hitting the floor close by, looksup at YOUNG COLE with panicky eyes, and asks....TERRIFIED TRAVELERJust exactly why did you volunteer?INT.  ENGINEERING OFFICE/FUTURE WORLD - (ETERNAL NIGHT)COLE comes abruptly awake.

He told meI volunteered.The SCIENTISTS react, whispering urgently among themselves.COLE starts to nod off again, then comes awake with a start asthe ENGINEER speaks to him.ENGINEERWe appreciate you volunteering.  Yourea very good observer, Cole.COLEUh, thank you.ENGINEERYoull get a reduction in sentence.COLE keeps his face impassive.ASTROPHYSICISTTo be determined by the proper authorities.ENGINEERYou dont want to jeopardize that reduction,do you, Cole?

A POET, tiny and ruddy faced, squints over hisglasses as he reads in a booming voice to an AUDIENCE of thirtyseated on folding chairs.POETStill among the myriad microwaves, theinfra-red messages, the gigabytes of onesand zeroes, we find words, infinitesimallysmall, byte-sized now, tinier even thanscience lurking in some vague electricitywhere, if we listen we can hear the solitaryvoice of that poet telling us,\"We are no other than a moving rowOf Magic shadow-shapes that come and goRound with the Sun-illumined Lantern holdIn Midnight by the Master of the show.\"As the POET reads, we STUDY the audience, mostly YUPPIE CULTUREJUNKIES or BOHEMIANS.  Among them, a light-haired woman of twenty-eight, soberly dressed, wearing glasses.  Shes KATHRYN RAILLY.  Andits her beeper that suddenly BEEPS.  BEEP!

BEEP!  Scowling at the outrageous interruption, the POETlooks up from the text just as RAILLY, tumbling, shuts off thebeeper and rises, embarrassed.  As she makes her way to an exit,the glaring POET continues...POET\"Yesterday This Days Madness did prepare;Tomorrows Silence, Triumph or Despair:Drink!  for you know not whence you came, nor why:Drink!  for you know not why you go, nor where.\"INT.  CORRIDOR/POLICE STATION - NIGHTDETECTIVE FRANKI leads RAILLY past crowded holding cells.FRANKI-- so they get there and they ask the guyreal nice for some kind of i.d., and he getsagitated, starts screaming about viruses.Totally irrational, totally disoriented,doesnt know where he is, what day it is,alla that stuff.  All they got was hisname.  They figure hes stoned out ofhis mind, its some kinda psychoticepisode, so theyre gonna bring him...RAILLYHes been tested for drugs?FRANKINegative for drugs.  But he took onfive cops like he was dusted to theeyeballs.  No drugs.  You believe that?FRANKI pauses, indicating a tiny observation window of thick meshedglass in an otherwise solid door, and RAILLY looks through it.RAILLYS POV THROUGH THE WINDOW:  a MAN, his back to her, instrait-jacket and prison denims, examining the wall of the paddedcell with the distorted intensity of a \"mental case\".RAILLYYou have him in restraints.FRANKIWere you listening?  We got two officers inthe hospital.  Yeah, hes in restraints, plusthe medic gave him enough stellazine to killa horse.  Look at him!  Still on his feet.RAILLYS POV THROUGH THE WINDOW:  the MAN in the cell turns, looksright at her.  In spite of the cuts and welts, its clearly COLE.RAILLYThat would explain the bruises, Iguess.  The struggle.FRANKIYou want to go in?  Examine him?RAILLYYes, please.  You said he gave a name...FRANKI(unlocking the door)James Cole.  Thats everything we got.

POLICE STATION CORRIDOR - MORNINGCOLE, bound tightly by the strait-jacket, heavy manacles on hisankles, is being escorted down the corridor by two surly POLICEMEN.COLEWhere are you taking me?POLICEMAN #1South of France, buddy.  Fancy hotel.Youre gonna love it.COLESouth of France?!  I dont want to goto the South of France.  I want to makea telephone call.POLICEMAN #2 smirks as he unlocks a heavy steel door.POLICEMAN #2Zip it, scumbag -- you fooled the shrinkwith your act, but you dont fool us.Then, POLICEMAN #2 swings the steel door open and sunlightoverwhelms COLE, blinding him in a dazzling fury of white light.EXT.

The Police Departmentlogo is prominent on the side of the van beneath barred windows.INT. COUNTY HOSPITAL/SHOWERS - AN HOUR LATER (MORNING)Fierce spray recalls the decontamination in the future.  COLEstands stark naked under the shower while two muscular attendants,PALMER and BILLINGS, supervise.As PALMER shuts off the water, BILLINGS hands COLE a towel andstarts inspecting his scalp...BILLINGSLemme see your head, Jimbo, see if yougot any creepy crawlies.COLEI need to make a telephone call.BILLINGS(pulling Coles head)Gotta work that out with a doctor, Jimbo.Cant make no calls til the doctor says.COLEIts very important.BILLINGSWhat chew gotta do, Jimbo, is take iteasy, relax into things.  We all gonnaget along fine if you just relax.COLE gets the hint of menace in the message and submits to thelice inspection, only his eyes revealing his frustration.INT.  HOSPITAL/DAYROOM - HALF AN HOUR LATER (DAY)COLE stands in the doorway, stunned by his first sight of thelarge room.  His eyes go to the heavily-grilled windows wherelight pours in from outside.  Then, to the TV, where a CARTOONCOMMERCIAL makes raucous noises.PATIENTS, in K-Mart street clothes or ratty robes, stare gloomilyat the TV, or play cards, pace, or just stare blankly.BILLINGS is at COLES side, beckoning to a patient, JEFFREY MASON,a twenty year old white youth dressed in khakis and a plaid shirt.BILLINGSJeffrey.  Yo!  Jeffrey.  This here is James.Whyncha show James around?  Tell him the TVrules, show him the games an stuff, okay?JEFFREY(with a sly look)How much you gonna pay me?  Huh?  Idbe doing your job.BILLINGSFive thousand dollars, my man.  Thatenough?  Ill wire it to your accountas usual, okay?JEFFREYOkay, Billings.  Five thousand.  Thatsenough.  Five thousand dollars.  Illgive him the Deluxe Mental Hospital Tour.As BILLINGS walks away chuckling, JEFFREY turns to COLE.JEFFREYKid around, kid around.  It makes them feelgood, were all pals.  Were prisoners, theyrethe guards, but its all in good fun, you see?COLE nods and JEFFREY indicates card tables where PATIENTS areplaying cards, checkers, chess, or working on jig saw puzzles.JEFFREYHeres the games.  Games vegitize you.If you play the games, yourevoluntarily taking a tranquilizer.COLE sees a partially completed puzzle of the well-known painting,THE PEACEABLE KINGDOM, depicting a serene world of animals in harmony.JEFFREYWhatd they give you?  Thorazine?  Howmuch?  Learn your drugs -- know your doses.COLEI need to make a telephone call.JEFFREYA telephone call?  Thats communicationwith the outside world!  Doctorsdiscretion.  Hey, if alla these nutscould just make phone calls, it couldspread.  Insanity oozing through telephonecables, oozing into the ears of all thosepoor sane people, infecting them!  Whackoseverywhere!  A plague of madness.(suddenly sly and confidential)In fact, very few of us here are actuallymentally ill.  Im not saying yourenot mentally ill, for all I know yourecrazy as a loon.  But thats not whyyoure here.  Why youre here is becauseof the system, because of the economy.(indicating the TV)Theres the TV.  Its all right there.Commercials.  We are not productiveanymore, they dont need us to makethings anymore, its all automated.  Whatare we for then?  Were consumers.  Okay,buy a lot of stuff, youre a good citizen.But if you dont buy a lot of stuff, youknow what?  Youre mentally ill! Thatsa fact!  If you dont buy things...toiletpaper, new cars, computerized blenders,electrically operated sexual devices...(getting hysterical)SCREWDRIVERS WITH MINIATURE BUILT-INRADAR DEVICES, STEREO SYSTEMS WITHBRAIN IMPLANTED HEADPHONES, VOICE-ACTIVATED COMPUTERS, AND...A woman orderly, TERRY, turns from the feeble PATIENT shes helping.TERRYTake it easy, Jeffrey.  Be calm.Abruptly, JEFFREY stifles his hysteria, takes a deep breath andcontinues, completely calm now.  But COLE isnt listening.  Hesmesmerized by the TV.JEFFREYSo if you want to watch a particularprogram, say \"All My Children\" orsomething, you go to the Charge Nurseand tell her what day and time the showyou want to see is on.  But you have totell her before the show is scheduledto be on.  There was this one guy whowas always requesting shows that had alreadyplayed.  He couldnt quite grasp theidea that the Charge Nurse couldntjust make it be yesterday for him, turnback time ha ha.  What a fruitcake!!This last thought actually penetrates COLES focus on the TV andhe turns to JEFFREY whos picking up speed again.JEFFREYSeriously, more and more people arebeing defined now as mentally ill.  Why?Because theyre not consuming on theirown.  But as patients, they beconeconsumers of mental health care.  Andthis gives the so-called sane people work!(hysteria again)WHOOO!  SHOCK THERAPY!  GROUP THERAPY!HALLUCINATIONS!  THERAPEUTIC DRUGS!IGGIDY DIGGIDY DIG!  PERFECT!  THESYSTEM IN HARMONY LIKE A BIG MACHINE...TERRYOkay, thats it, Jeffrey, youre gonnaget a shot.  I warned you...JEFFREY(calming himself, smiling)Right!  Right!  Carried away, heh heh.I got \"carried away\".  Explaining theworkings of...the institution.Just then, TJ WASHINGTON, a somber-looking African American in abathrobe, taps COLE on the shoulder.TJ WASHINGTONI dont really come from outer space.JEFFREYThis is TJ Washington, Jim -- hedoesnt really come from outer space.TJ WASHINGTONDont mock me, my friend.(to Cole)Its a condition of \"mental divergence\".I find myself on another planet, Ogo,part of an intellectual elite, preparingto subjugate barbarian hordes on Pluto.But even though its a totally convincingreality in every way...I can feel, breathe,hear...nevertheless, Ogo is actually aconstruct of my psyche.  I am mentallydivergent in that I am escaping certainunnamed realities that plague my lifehere.  When I stop going there, I willbe well.  Are you also divergent, friend?The P.A. SYSTEM interrupts, startling COLE.P.A. SYSTEM (v.o.)James Cole.  Report to Staff.  James Cole!JEFFREYStaff!  Whoo!  Time for Staff.  Now thegeniuses cure you.  Hallelujah!INT.  PSYCH WARD CONFERENCE ROOM - MINUTES LATER (DAY)COLE is agitated, speaking forcefully.COLEThis is a place for crazy people!  Imnot crazy!RAILLY, four other PSYCHIATRIC RESIDENTS, including RAILLYS bestfriend, MARILOU MARTIN, and their chief, DR. OWEN FLETCHER, sitaround a beat-up conference table, watching COLE, who sits facingthe doctors, with BILLINGS looming behind him.  (Some of the DOCTORSbear a strong resemblance to the SCIENTISTS OF THE FUTURE.)RESIDENT #1We dont use that term...\"crazy\", Mr. Cole.COLEWell, youve got some real nuts in here!Listen to me, all of you -- I have totell you something thats going to bedifficult for you to understand, but...DR.

Do youknow what year it is right now?COLE1989.  Look, Im not confused.  Theres beena mistake, Ive been sent to the wrong place.Suddenly, COLE reaches out and BILLINGS lunges forward, but COLEis just grabbing a pad and pencil.COLEHey, Im not going to hurt anybody.FLETCHER restrains BILLINGS with a hand signal.COLE(drawing)Do any of you know anything about theArmy of the Twelve Monkeys?  They paintthis, stencil it, on buildings, allover the place.COLE waves a sketch of the dancing monkey logo we saw earlier.DR. CASEYMr. Cole...COLERight.  I guess you wouldnt, this is1989, theyre probably not active yet.That makes sense!  Okay.  Listen to me,three billion people died in 1995.Three billion, got that?  Almostthe whole population.  Of the world!Only about one percent survived.DOCTORS exchange knowing looks.  This is an old story, apparently.RESIDENT #2Are you going to save us, Mr. Cole?COLESave you?  How can I save you?  Italready happened!  I cant save you.  Imsimply trying to get some information forpeople in the present so that someday...(sees their eyes)You dont believe me.  You think Imcrazy.  But Im not crazy.  Im a convict,sure, I have a quick temper, but Im assane as anyone in this room.  I...COLE stops, sees DR. FLETCHER tapping his pencil.  COLES seenthat tapping before -- in the future!  It disorients him.DR. RAILLYCan you tell us the name of the prisonyouve come from?COLE doesnt answer.  Hes staring at the tapping pencil.DR. FLETCHERDoes this bother you, Mr. Cole?COLE(recovering, new tack)No!  Look, I dont belong here!  What Ineed to do is make a telephone call tostraighten everything out.DR. FLETCHERWho would you call, Mr. Cole, who wouldstraighten everything out?COLEScientists.  Im supposed to report into them.  Theyll want to know theysent me to the wrong time.DR. FLETCHERSo you could talk to these scientistsand they do what?  Send you to the future?COLENo, no.  I cant talk to them.  Its called,\"voice mail\".  Im supposed to leave messages.They monitor it from the present.RESIDENT #2\"From the present.\"  Were not in thepresent now, Mr. Cole?COLENo, no.  This is the past.  This hasalready happened.  Listen...RESIDENT #3Mr. Cole, you belong in 1995 -- thatsthe present, is that it?COLENo, 1995 is the past, too.  Look...DR. FLETCHERThese scientists, Mr. Cole?  Are theydoctors like ourselves?Two of the residents exchange quick knowing looks.COLENo!  I mean yes, but... Look, Ive been givena lot of drugs but Im still perfectly lucid.You have to let me use the phone.  One call!COLE looks desperately toward RAILLY, pleading eyes meeting hers.INT.  LOW RENT APARTMENT - DAYFour little KIDS SCREAM and SQUABBLE while the phone CHIRPSinsistently in the tiny, cluttered apartment and a harried MOTHERlunges for the phone, answers sharply...MOTHERYes?(listens, frowns, then)Whaaaaat?  \"Voice mail\"!  I dont knowwhat youre talkin about. ... Is thisa joke?  I dont know any scientists.James who?  Never heard of you!The MOTHER slams down the phone.INT.  RAILLYS OFFICE/COUNTY HOSPITAL - DAYA dismayed COLE still has the receiver in his hand.

She didnt know anything.RAILLYPerhaps it was a wrong number...COLENo.  Thats the reason they chose me --I remember things.RAILLY frowns, studying the distracted man with intense interest.Its clear COLE is becoming a special patient and RAILLYS cool,detached demeanor is giving way ever so slightly.RAILLYJames, where did you grow up?  Was itaround here?  Around Baltimore?COLE(lost in thought)What?RAILLYI have the...strangest feeling Ive metyou before...a long time ago, perhaps.Were you ever...?COLEWait!  This is only 1989!

How can I contact them?RAILLY recovers her distance, her poise, as she takes a bottle,pours out some tablets, and holds them out to COLE.RAILLYJames, take these.(watching him step back)Please -- I helped you like I said Iwould.

DORMITORY (PSYCH WARD)/COUNTY HOSPITAL - NIGHTCOLES eyes blink awake, blinded by a flashlight.Hes lying in one of thirty beds in a darkened ward.  Disoriented.Which world is this?  The room is full of BREATHING, SNORING,occasional MOANS.  He can barely discern the shadowy figures ofan ORDERLY and a NURSE, making their rounds, checking each bed.His eyes adjusting to the darkness, COLE watches them exit.He turns and sees a patch of moonlight coming in a barred window.With a quick glance at the sleeping PATIENTS, he slips out ofbed, makes his way stealthily to the window, peers out.COLES POV:  the moon, glowing in the sky, illuminating a singletree.  Under the tree, in silhouette, a COUPLE embraces, kisses.ANGLE ON COLE, looking out the window, absorbed.VOICE (o.s.)It wont work.

And all the doors arelocked, too.  Theyre protecting thepeople on the outside from us.  But thepeople outside are as crazy as us.COLE has become preoccupied with a small SPIDER creeping alongthe window sill.  Hes staring at it when hes distracted by asudden SOUND.  Grabbing the SPIDER, COLE scrambles back into bedjust as the door opens and an ORDERLY probes the dark room withthe blade of his flashlight.ANGLE ON COLE, in bed, feigning sleep.The flashlight clicks off and COLE hears the door close.For a long moment the ward is silent except for BREATHING,SNORES, occasional MOANS.  Then, COLE hears JEFFREYS hoarsewhisper, picking up right where he left off.JEFFREYYou know what \"crazy\" is?  \"crazy\" is\"majority rules\".  Take germs for example.Although COLE is preoccupied with the SPIDER struggling to getout of his fist, he cant help reacting to the word, \"germs\"!COLEGerms?!JEFFREYIn the 18th century there was no suchthing!  Nobodyd ever imagined such athing -- no sane person anyway.  Alongcomes this doctor...Semmelweiss, Ithink.  He tries to convince people...other doctors mostly...that there arethese teeny tiny invisible \"bad things\"called germs that get into your body andmake you...sick!  Hes trying to getdoctors to wash their hands.  What isthis guy...crazy?  Teeny tiny invisiblewhaddayou call em?...\"germs\"!As JEFFREY warms to his subject, getting excited, COLE tries tofigure out where to put the SPIDER.JEFFREY (cont.)So cut to the 20th century!  Last weekin fact, right before I got draggedinto this hellhole.  I order a burgerin this fast food joint.  The waiterdrops it on the floor.  He picks it up,wipes it off, hands it to me...like itwas all okay.No alternative.  COLE pops the SPIDER in his mouth and swallowsit as JEFFREY prattles on...JEFFREY\"What about the germs?\"  I say.  Hegoes, \"I dont believe in germs.  Germsare just a plot they made up so theycan sell you disinfectants and soap!\"Now, hes crazy, right?  Hey, youbelieve in germs, dont you?COLEIm not crazy.JEFFREYOf course not, I never thought you were.You want to escape, right?  Thats verysane.  I can help you.  You want me to,dont you?  Get you out?COLEIf you know how to escape, why dont you...?JEFFREYWhy dont I escape, thats what youwere going to ask me, right?  CauseId be crazy to escape!  Im all takencare of, see?

He looks down at the key in his hand.ANGLE ON JEFFREY, being grabbed by the ORDERLIES.  JEFFREYresists wildly as they struggle to overpower him.JEFFREYLAST CHANCE!  LAST CHANCE!  HEY -- OW!ANGLE ON COLE, moving to the door.  He reaches it and tries toinsert the key in the lock.ANGLE ON LOCK, as the key keeps missing the hole.ANGLE ON COLE, glancing nervously over his shoulder.COLES POV:  ORDERLIES swarm over JEFFREY, dont notice COLE.ANGLE ON COLE, managing to insert the key.  It wont turn.A PATIENT, close at hand, startles COLE, speaking into his ear.PATIENTPlace to go would be...Florida.

CORRIDOR/COUNTY HOSPITALStepping through the door, COLE finds himself in an ante-roomfacing several elevators.A uniformed SECURITY MAN sitting at a near-by desk doesnt evenlock up from the magazine hes reading.Barely daring to breathe, COLE steps toward the elevators so hisback is to the SECURITY MAN.  But he doesnt know how to controlthis elevator.  What should he do?SECURITY MANS VOICE (o.s.)Twos not working today.  Use one.COLE freezes, sneaks a glance over his shoulder.COLES POV:  the SECURITY MAN continues his reading.  Hes a bigguy with reading glasses perched on his nose.  He looks exactlylike the MENACING GUARD IN THE FUTURE...SCARFACE!ANGLE ON COLE, stunned!Just then, an elevator door slides open.  The elevators empty.COLE steps into it.INT.  ELEVATOR/COUNTY HOSPITALThe door closes, isolating COLE in the elevator.COLE finds the down button, is about to push it when the elevatorsprings to life.

COLLEGE CAMPUS - NIGHTStunningly quiet.  We are on a placid campus looking at thedignified architecture of Breitrose Hall.

KATHRYN RAILLYMADNESS AND APOCALYPTIC VISIONSMAY 17INT.  AUDITORIUM/BREITROSE HALL - NIGHTA large screen dominates the auditorium stage.  On the screen isa slide of an engraving from the Middle Ages showing a MADMAN inapparent agony, his mouth shaped to a scream, as he is restrainedby PEASANTS.  The projector ZOOMS slowly in on the agonized FACEof this MADMAN as we HEAR RAILLYS VOICE lecturing.RAILLYS VOICE (o.s.)According to the accounts of localofficials at that time, this gentleman,judged to be about forty years of age,appeared suddenly in the village of Wylenear Stonehenge in the West of England inApril of 1162.  Using unfamiliar words andspeaking in a strange accent, the man madedire prognostications about a pestilencewhich he predicted would wipe out humanityin approximately 8OO years.  Deranged andhysterical, the man raped a young woman of thevillage, was taken into custody, but thenmysteriously escaped and was not heard of again.WE DISCOVER RAILLY, six years older now, standing at a lecternin a pool of light.  Shes dwarfed by the giant screen where theengraving is replaced by a series of slides of woodcuts showingscenes of pestilence in the Middle Ages as she lectures to anaudience of mostly SCHOLARLY TYPES.RAILLY (cont.)In 1841, Mackay wrote, \"During seasonsof great pestilence, men have oftenbelieved the prophecies of crazedfanatics, that the end of the world wascome.\"  Obviously, this plague/doomsdayscenario is considerably more compellingwhen reality supports it in some form,whether its the Bubonic Plague, smallpox,or AIDS.  In addition to these \"natural\"contagions, there are now technologicalhorrors as well:  besides radiation,consider our lurking fear of germwarfare and its close approximation,chemical warfare, which first rearedits ugly head in the deadly mustardgas attacks during the First World War.ON THE SCREEN, a SERIES of SLIDES show images of WORLD WAR ISOLDIERS in gas masks, in death throes, etc..RAILLYS VOICE (cont. o.s.)During such an attack in the Frenchtrenches in October, 1917, we have anaccount of this soldier...ON THE SCREEN, a slide of an old deteriorated photograph showsJOSE, the Puerto Rican kid, strapped to a stretcher, being carriedby SOLDIERS through the trenches during an attack.  JOSE appearsto be ranting madly as the projector ZOOMS CLOSER on his face untilthe image approximates Munchs famous painting.RAILLYS VOICE (cant. o.s.)-- who, during an assault, was woundedby shrapnel and hospitalized behind thelines where Doctors discovered he hadlost all comprehension of French butspoke English fluently, albeit in aregional dialect they didnt recognize.The man, although physically unaffectedby the gas, was hysterical.  He claimedhe had come from the future, that he waslooking for a pure germ that wouldultimately wipe mankind off the face ofthe earth in the year... 1995!The AUDIENCE gives a nervous CHUCKLE.ON THE SCREEN, a different old photograph of JOSE.  This timehes in a military hospital, gaunt, haunted, very ill.RAILLYS VOICE (cont. o.s.)Although seriously injured, the youngsoldier disappeared from the hospitalbefore more data could be gathered.  Nodoubt, he was trying to carry on hismission to warn others, substitutingfor the agony of war...a self-inflictedagony we call the \"Cassandra Complex\".As RAILLY continues, we SCAN the AUDIENCE and DISCOVER MARILOU MARTIN,RAILLYS friend, and MARILOUS HUSBAND, WAYNE CHANG, both listeningattentively.  Further away, another MAN listens intently.  A MAN withshoulder-length carrot-colored hair.  His name is DR. PETERS.RAILLY (cont.)Cassandra, in Greek legend you will recall,was condemned to know the future but to bedisbelieved when she foretold it.  Hence,the agony of foreknowledge combined withimpotence to do anything about it.INT.  RECEPTION ROOM - AN HOUR LATER (NIGHT)A stack of new books.  THE DOOMSDAY SYNDROME, ApocalypticVisions of the Mentally Ill by Dr. Kathryn RaillySurrounded by enthusiastic members of the audience, RAILLY isseated at the table signing books but DR. PETERS has her ear.DR. PETERSI think, Dr. Railly, you have givenyour alarmists a bad name.  Surelythere is very real and very convincingdata that the planet cannot survive theexcesses of the human race:  proliferationof atomic devices, uncontrolled breedinghabits, the rape of the environment, thepollution of land, sea, and air.  In thiscontext, isnt it obvious that \"ChickenLittle\" represents the sane vision andthat Homo Sapiens motto, \"Lets goshopping!\" is the cry of the true lunatic?DR. PETERS smiles self-importantly at RAILLY as an elderlydisheveled PROFESSOR elbows in front of him. DISHEVELED PROFESSORDoctor Railly -- please!  I wonder ifyoure aware of my own studies whichindicate that certain cycles of themoon actually impact on the incidenceof apocalyptic predictions as observedin urban emergency rooms and...As the PROFESSOR babbles, MARILOU MARTIN and her husband, WAYNECHANG, appear and whisper...MARILOUYou were great.RAILLYYoure leaving?MARILOUThe reservations at nine thirty --its getting late.DISHEVELED PROFESSORDoctor Railly -- please -- this is veryimportant!WAYNE CHANG(checking the professor)You sure youre gonna be all right?RAILLY(smiles, checks her watch)Ill be there in twenty minutes.DISHEVELED PROFESSORDr. Railly, I simply cannot understandyour exclusion of the moon in relationto apocalyptic dementia...EXT.  PARKING LOT/BREITROSE HALL - NIGHTA full moon.COLLEAGUES in a VOLVO pull out of the parking lot, calling,\"Congratulations\" to RAILLY.She waves back as she hurries to her black ACURA, one of the lastcars left in the lot.The outside lights of Breitrose Hall go off.RAILLY seems to be alone in the lot as she fishes keys from herpurse, unlocks her car door, starts to open it when...Suddenly, shes grabbed from behind in a choke-hold by a largeshadowy MAN looming out of the darkness behind her.MANS VOICEGet in!Unable to scream, she writhes and kicks as he forces her into thefront seat.MANS VOICEIve got a gun.RAILLY freezes, terrified, as he opens the rear door andscrambles in behind her.INT.

ACURA/PARKING LOTThe engine STARTS, the Acura backs up, then heads for the exit.INT.  ACURASteering fearfully, RAILLY hears him speak more calmly now.MANS VOICE (o.s.)I dont want to hurt you.  But I will.Ive hurt people before when...when Ihad no choice.  Turn left.As she makes the turn, RAILLY glances in the rear view mirror,sees him unfolding a tattered map.  His face is lost in darknessbut she glimpses ragged, torn clothing as he tries to read themap by the intermittent glow of passing street lights.RAILLYWhere... where are we goingMANI need you to drive me to Philadelphia.RAILLY(startled, horrified)But thats... thats more than 200 miles!MANThats why I cant walk there.  Turnhere... I think...RAILLY obeys.  She glances in the mirror again, hesitates, thenboldly switches on the dome light, holding her breath fearfullyfor his reaction.He grunts appreciatively.  Relieved, she looks in the mirroragain, trying to get a better look at him, but now his featuresare concealed by the map.RAILLYIf you make me go with you, itskidnapping.  Thats a serious crime.If you let me go, you could just takethe car and...MANI dont know how to drive!  We wentunderground when I was nine, I told youthat.  When you come to the corner,turn right.Startled, RAILLY whirls, looks right at him.Hes lowered the map.  Its COLE!  Haggard, unshaven, dirty.RAILLYCole!  James Cole!  You escaped from alocked room six years ago.COLE1989.  Six years for you.  Theres thesign!  Right here!COLE is indicating a freeway entrance.RAILLY turns the wheel sharply.EXT.

I know thisisnt what you meant, but...I was desperate...no money...bum leg... sleeping on the streets.I probably smell bad.  Sorry about that.But then I saw your book in a store windowwith a notice about your lecture.(sudden pride)I can read, remember?RAILLYYes, I remember.(a beat, then)Why do you want to go to Philadelphia?COLEIts the next step.  I checked out theBaltimore information, it was nothing.Its Philadelphia, thats where theyare, the ones who killed everyone.(pointing suddenly, eagerly)Zs that a radio?  Does it play music?RAILLY turns on the radio and immediately WE HEAR the SOUND of SURFand the CRIES of gulls, background to an oozing baritone COMMERCIAL.COMMERCIAL/RADIO (o.s.)This is a personal message to you.COLE sits up, alert, listening intently.COMMERCIAL/RADIO (cont. o.s.)Are you at the end of your rope?  Areyou dying to get away?COLES eyes narrow, concentrating on this personal message.COMMERCAIL/RADIO (cont. o.s.}The Florida Keys are waiting for you.COLE frowns as the SOUND of breaking SURF and crying GULLS fillsthe car.  Its confusing!  He blurts out...COLEIve never seen the ocean!Observing his confusion in the mirror, RAILLY assumes herprofessional tone.RAILLYIts an advertisement, Mr. Cole.  Youdo understand that, dont you?  Itsnot really a special message to you.COLE frowns.  He did think it was for him, but shes probably right.COLEYou used to call me \"James\".RAILLYYoud prefer that? ... James...youdont really have a gun, do you.COLE(cynical laugh)Everybodys got a gun.
