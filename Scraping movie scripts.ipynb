SYSTEM droning Flight Information mingled with thesounds of urgent SHOUTS, running FEET, EXCLAMATIONS.YOUNG COLES POV:  twenty yards away, a BLONDE MAN is sprawled onthe floor, blood oozing from his gaudy Hawaiian shirt.A BRUNETTE in a tight dress, her face obscured from YOUNG COLESview, rushes to the injured man, kneels beside him, ministeringto his wound.ANGLE ON YOUNG COLE, flanked by his PARENTS, their faces out ofview, as they steer him away.FATHERS VOICE (o.s.)Come on, Son --this is no place for us.YOUNG COLE resists momentarily, mesmerized by the drama.YOUNG COLES POV:  intermittently visible through a confusion ofFIGURES rushing through the foreground, the BLONDE MAN reachingup and touching the cheek of the kneeling BRUNETTE in a gestureof enormous tenderness, a gesture of farewell, while the P.A.SYSTEM continues its monotonous monotone...P.A.

SYSTEM--number 5429, Garcia -- number 87645, Cole...COLE, late thirties, dark hair, comes awake in a bunk cage, oneof many stacked four high along both sides of a long dimcorridor.  He blinks in the near dark, shaken, disoriented.Then, as he \"recovers\" from his very vivid dream, WE GET OURFIRST LOOK AT HIS ENVIRONMENT...A WINDOWLESS UNDERGROUND WORLD OFETERNAL NIGHT SOMETIME IN THE FUTURE...AN ALMOST COLORLESS\"REALITY\" OF BLURRED EDGES AND ECHOEY SOUNDS, MUCH MORE\"DREAMLIKE\" THAN HIS DREAM.Flashlights glare. In the half-light, COLE sees spooky figures,GUARDS, moving among the locked bunk/cages.COLE turns and whispers to the occupant of the next cage, JOSE...COLESsssst!  Jose, whats going on?JOSEs face is almost lost in shadow.  What there is of it isyouthful.  Hes just a scared Puerto Rican kid!JOSE\"Volunteers\" again.JOSE immediately rolls over and feigns sleep as SCARFACE, amenacing guard with a jagged scar running down his cheek, loomsclose to COLEs cage and unlocks it.SCARFACE\"Volunteer duty\".    The PRISONERS in the other cages watch silently with narrowed eyes.COLEI didnt volunteer.SCARFACEYou causing trouble again?COLE(controls his temper)No trouble.INT.  EQUIPMENT ROOM - ETERNAL NIGHTCOLEs alone, struggling to get into what looks like a space suitin a room where suits hang like ghosts with blank eyes.TITLES BEGIN SUPERED OVER THE SCENECOLE has the torso of the suit on now and is trying to close it.OFFSCREEN VOICE (o.s.)All openings must be closed.COLE looks for the source of the voice, a tiny grate in the wall.OFFSCREEN VOICE (o.s.)If the integrity of the suit is compromisedin any way, if the fabric is torn or a zippernot closed, readmittance will be denied.INT.  SEALED CHAMBER - MINUTES LATER (ETERNAL NIGHT)COLE, wearing the \"space suit\" and a helmet with a plastic visor,steps into a tiny chamber, a kind of air lock.  The heavy doorclangs shut behind him.  Hes alone.  COLES breath comes quickernow as he sucks oxygen from the air tanks on his back.On the opposite wall is another door with a huge wheel lock.COLE turns the heavy wheel, opens the door, steps through ItINT.  ELEVATOR - SECONDS LATER (ETERNAL NIGHT)COLES in an ascending elevator that groans and creaks.  He looksdown at a crudely drawn map he holds in his gloved hand.The map shows a series of tunnels and ladders.INT.  SEWER PIPE - MINUTES LATER (NIGHT)COLE pans a flashlight, probing the filthy sewer hes wading throughRATS flee the blade of light, scurry across islands of rusting junk.The flashlight beam settles on a ladder mounted in the wall.Reaching the rusted ladder, COLE starts to climb awkwardly.EXT.  CITY STREET/FUTURE - MOMENTS LATER (NIGHT)A SCRAPING NOISE as a heavy man-hole cover is pushed up and movedaside.  COLES helmeted head emerges from below.COLES POV THROUGH HIS PLASTIC-VISORED HELMET:  a city inmoonlight!  A surreal image of abandoned buildings.  No peopleanywhere.  The only sounds are the WIND and COLES BREATHING.EXT.  ANOTHER CITY STREET - MINUTES LATER (NIGHT)COLES light reveals abandoned vine-covered automobiles.Moving to the nearest car, COLE searches in the vines forsomething.  Finds it.  An insect.COLE takes the bug in his gloved hand.  As he clumsily inserts itinto a collection tube, something makes him turn.Theres something across the street in the dark.  Something alive.COLE points his flashlight and reveals...a BEAR!  Startled by thelight, the animal blinks, then stands on its rear legs and ROARS.ANGLE ON COLE, staring wide-eyed.Then, the BEAR sinks down onto all fours and, trying to avoid theflashlight, it pads quickly down the street.INT.  SUBTERRANEAN PARKING GARAGE - NIGHTUsing the flashlight to see, COLE reaches down to the crackedfloor and gets another specimen.  DOGSHIT!The only sound is COLES labored BREATHING.Then, a different SOUND.  GRRRR!  A dog.  More GRRRRS.  Moredogs.  Then, a YIP.  Then, VICIOUS GROWLS.  Its a DOGFIGHT!EXT.  STREET - NIGHT (FIRST LIGHT)A giant OWL, perched on an overhead traffic light, raises its wingsand lifts off...rising higher and higher into the brightening sky.Below, on the street, COLE trudges along, passing desertedbuildings, windows broken, rusted signs dangling.INT.  DEPARTMENT STORE - NIGHT (FIRST LIGHT)COLES light reveals a spider web just inside the store.  A largeSPIDER tries to hide from the light.COLE reaches carefully into the web and plucks the spider andputs it into one of his specimen tubes.Then, he shines his light all around the once elegant store.  Theresnothing but aisle after aisle of moldering consumer goods.EXT.  DEPARTMENT STORE - DAWNAs COLE comes out of the store, the first rays of the sun hit thebuilding.  COLE stops, squints into the light through his visor.COLES POV:  spray-painted on the wall a long time ago is a stenciledlogo of twelve monkeys holding hands in a circle.  Over it iswritten, \"WE DID IT!\"COLE looks up.COLES POV:  high up on a building across the street, a LIONpatrols a ledge, pauses, looks out majestically over his world.TTTLES ENDINT.  FIRST UNDERGROUND DECONTAMINATION CHAMBER - ETERNAL NIGHTROARING WATER, powerful torrents gushing from nozzles in thewall, pummel the still-suited COLE.INT.  SECOND UNDERGROUND DECONTAMINATION CHAMBER - ETERNAL NIGHTStark naked and shivering, COLE is being scrubbed with brushes onlong poles (like the ones used to wash cars) wielded by two HULKINGFIGURES in bulky decontamination suits, their personas lost in theirwindowed masks.  Its a grim scene in a grim cement room with damp,dripping walls.  From an unseen source comes an AMPLIFIED VOICE,AMPLIFIED VOICE (o.s.)Raise your arms above your head.COLE lifts his arms and the FIGURES start scrubbing his armpits.INT.  TINY CHAMBER - SHORTLY (ETERNAL NIGHT)Still naked, COLE is seated on a stool while a MASKED TECHNICIANin a less elaborate, less bulky decontamination outfit drawsblood from COLES arm with an old-fashioned hypodermic needle.COLE glances toward a single, nearly opaque \"window\" of thickplastic in the rusty iron wall.  VAGUE FIGURES seem to lurkbehind the translucent aperture, studying him.The TECHNICIAN slips the blood sample through a slot in the wall.INT.  ENGINEERING OFFICE/FUTURE WORLD - ETERNAL NIGHTUshered in by two guards, TINY and SCARFACE, COLE looks around.COLES POV:  wails hidden by old headlines, articles, maps, charts...a blackboard covered with elaborate, sophisticated formulae...surfacesheaped with cracked monitors, gerry-rigged computers held together withstring, lasers lost in tangles of cable, ancient tube amplifiers, adilapidated cardboard reconstruction of a city, stacks of molderingbooks and tattered computer printouts...and, seated at a long conferencetable, staring at COLE, six SCIENTISTS:  an ASTROPHYSICIST, ENGINEER,BOTANIST, MICROBIOLOGIST, ZOOLOGIST, and a GEOLOGIST.  They representa \"modern\" science where brilliant new ideas interface with crude,outdated, patched-together technologies.TINYJames Cole.  Cleared from quarantine.MICROBIOLOGISTThank you.  You two wait outside.SCARFACEHes got a history, Doctor.  Violence.COLES eyes return to the walls.Headlines:  \"CLOCK TICKING!  NO CURE YET!\"SCARFACEAnti-social six -- doing 25 to life.ENGINEERI dont think hes going to hurt us.  Yourenot going to hurt us, are you Mr. Cole?COLES head turns quickly to the ENGINEER.COLENo, sir.The GUARDS exchange a look, shrug, exit, closing the door.MICROBIOLOGISTWhy dont you sit down, Mr. Cole.COLE goes to the empty chair at the conference table, sits down.ASTROPHYSICISTWe want you to tell us about lastnight.COLEI went to the surface and I collectedspecimens like I was told.The SCIENTISTS dont say anything.  They just study him carefully.COLE(worried)I mashed the spider, didnt I?MICROBIOLOGISTWell get to the spider later, Mr.Cole.  Right now, we want to knoweverything that you saw.INT.  ENGINEERING OFFICE - AN HOUR LATER (ETERNAL NIGHT)COLE, starting to look very tired now, stands at the blackboardsketching a detailed map of exactly where he was last night.ASTPOPHYSICISTWhere you collected sample #4, whatstreet was that?COLEUh...BOTANISTIts important to observe everything.COLEI think it was...Im sure it was 2nd Street.As the SCIENTISTS start to whisper animatedly among themselves,COLES eyes drift across the newspaper clippings taped to thewall.  One headline screams, \"VIRUS MUTATING!\"  Another featuresa photo of an OLD MAN (DR. MASON, who well see again later on)and the words, SCIENTIST SAYS, \"ITS TOO LATE FOR CURE\".ASTROPHYSICISTS VOICE (o.s.)Close your eyes, Cole.Startled, COLE closes his eyes obediently.BLACKNESS.  Like COLE, WE SEE NOTHING.  But we HEAR their VOICES.ENGINEERS VOICE (o.s.)Tell us in detail what youve seen inthis room.COLES VOICE (o.s.)Uh, in this room?  Uh...MICROBIOLOGISTS VOICE (o.s.)How many of us are there?COLES VOICE (o.s.)Six...seven, if you count me.ASTROPHYSICISTS VOICE (o.s.)Tell us about the pictures on the wall...COLES VOICE (o.s.)Uh, you mean the newspapers?A MONTAGE OF OVERLAPPING VOICES (o.s.)Tell us about the newspapers.  Can youhear my voice?  What do I look like?What does he look like, the man whojust spoke?  How old were you when youleft the surface?The VOICES blur into a cacophony and FADE INTO the droning P.A.SYSTEM at the airport.INT.  CONCOURSE/AIRPORT - DAYTHE DREAM AGAIN!  But at an earlier moment.  YOUNG COLE, flankedby his PARENTS, whose faces are out of view, is watching a PLANEland through one of the big glass windows that lines the concourseleading to the departure gates.P.A. SYSTEM (o.s.)Flight 784 now boarding at gate...Suddenly, a SHOUT, followed by raised VOICES, interrupts themonotonous airport routine.  As YOUNG COLE and his PARENTS turnto see whats going on, a man well call MR. PONYTAIL, his faceaverted, hurries past them, bumping YOUNG COLE with a ChicagoHulls Sports Duffle Bag.MR. PONYTAILWATCH IT!YOUNG COLE sees little more than the gaudy pants, the duffle, andthe mans ponytail flopping as he rushes towards the gates.Just then, a WOMANS VOICE cries out, \"NOOOOOOOOO!\"YOUNG COLE turns back toward the Security Check Point just asTRAVELERS scatter madly, some diving to the floor, othersrunning.  A TERRIFIED TRAVELER, hitting the floor close by, looksup at YOUNG COLE with panicky eyes, and asks....TERRIFIED TRAVELERJust exactly why did you volunteer?INT.  ENGINEERING OFFICE/FUTURE WORLD - (ETERNAL NIGHT)COLE comes abruptly awake.  Seated now, hes facing the SCIENTISTS.ASTROPHYSICISTWake up, Cole.COLEUh, I didnt hear the...MICROBIOLOGIST(tapping a pencil on the table)I asked you, why did you volunteer?COLEWell, the guard woke me up.  He told meI volunteered.The SCIENTISTS react, whispering urgently among themselves.COLE starts to nod off again, then comes awake with a start asthe ENGINEER speaks to him.ENGINEERWe appreciate you volunteering.  Yourea very good observer, Cole.COLEUh, thank you.ENGINEERYoull get a reduction in sentence.COLE keeps his face impassive.ASTROPHYSICISTTo be determined by the proper authorities.ENGINEERYou dont want to jeopardize that reduction,do you, Cole?  Have it taken away?COLENo, sir!ASTROPHYSICISTWe have a very advanced program, somethingvery different, requires very skilled people.MICROBIOLOGISTAn opportunity to reduce your sentenceconsiderably...ZOOLOGISTAnd possibly play an important role inreturning the human race to the surfaceof the earth.ENGINEERWe want tough minded people.  Strongmentally.  Weve had some...misfortuneswith \"unstable\" types.ASTROPHYSICISTFor a man in your position...an opportunity.BOTANISTNot to volunteer could be a real mistake.MICROBIOLOGIST(tapping his pencil again)Definitely a mistake!COLE gives away nothing.  Hes in a box here.  He has no choices.He stares at the tapping pencil.INT.  ART GALLERY - NIGHTA strikingly \"real\" world of bright colors.  Extravagant paintingsadorn the walls.  A POET, tiny and ruddy faced, squints over hisglasses as he reads in a booming voice to an AUDIENCE of thirtyseated on folding chairs.POETStill among the myriad microwaves, theinfra-red messages, the gigabytes of onesand zeroes, we find words, infinitesimallysmall, byte-sized now, tinier even thanscience lurking in some vague electricitywhere, if we listen we can hear the solitaryvoice of that poet telling us,\"We are no other than a moving rowOf Magic shadow-shapes that come and goRound with the Sun-illumined Lantern holdIn Midnight by the Master of the show.\"As the POET reads, we STUDY the audience, mostly YUPPIE CULTUREJUNKIES or BOHEMIANS.  Among them, a light-haired woman of twenty-eight, soberly dressed, wearing glasses.  Shes KATHRYN RAILLY.  Andits her beeper that suddenly BEEPS.  BEEP!  BEEP!POETS VOICE (o.s.)\"The Moving Finger writes; and, having writ,Moves on:  nor all your Piety nor WitShall lure it back to cancel half a Line,Nor all your Tears wash out a Word of it.\"BEEP!  BEEP!  Scowling at the outrageous interruption, the POETlooks up from the text just as RAILLY, tumbling, shuts off thebeeper and rises, embarrassed.  As she makes her way to an exit,the glaring POET continues...POET\"Yesterday This Days Madness did prepare;Tomorrows Silence, Triumph or Despair:Drink!  for you know not whence you came, nor why:Drink!  for you know not why you go, nor where.\"INT.  CORRIDOR/POLICE STATION - NIGHTDETECTIVE FRANKI leads RAILLY past crowded holding cells.FRANKI-- so they get there and they ask the guyreal nice for some kind of i.d., and he getsagitated, starts screaming about viruses.Totally irrational, totally disoriented,doesnt know where he is, what day it is,alla that stuff.  All they got was hisname.  They figure hes stoned out ofhis mind, its some kinda psychoticepisode, so theyre gonna bring him...RAILLYHes been tested for drugs?FRANKINegative for drugs.  But he took onfive cops like he was dusted to theeyeballs.  No drugs.  You believe that?FRANKI pauses, indicating a tiny observation window of thick meshedglass in an otherwise solid door, and RAILLY looks through it.RAILLYS POV THROUGH THE WINDOW:  a MAN, his back to her, instrait-jacket and prison denims, examining the wall of the paddedcell with the distorted intensity of a \"mental case\".RAILLYYou have him in restraints.FRANKIWere you listening?  We got two officers inthe hospital.  Yeah, hes in restraints, plusthe medic gave him enough stellazine to killa horse.  Look at him!  Still on his feet.RAILLYS POV THROUGH THE WINDOW:  the MAN in the cell turns, looksright at her.  In spite of the cuts and welts, its clearly COLE.RAILLYThat would explain the bruises, Iguess.  The struggle.FRANKIYou want to go in?  Examine him?RAILLYYes, please.  You said he gave a name...FRANKI(unlocking the door)James Cole.  Thats everything we got.  Noneof the James Coles on the computer match him.No license, no prints, no warrants.  Nothing.You want me to go in with you?RAILLY(entering)No, thank you.FRANKIIll be right here...just in case.INT.  ISOLATION CELLCOLE stares at RAILLY.  The environment is intensely real...vividcolors...each sound, however slight, very distinct, almost loud...and yet she appears to him almost like a vision.RAILLYMr. Cole?  My name is Doctor Railly.Im a psychiatrist.  I work for theCounty -- I dont work for the police.My only concern is your well being --do you understand that?COLEI need to go now.RAILLYIm going to be completely honest.  Imnot going to lie to you.  I cant makethe police let you go...but I do wantto help you.  And I want you to trustme.  Can you do that, James?  May Icall you \"James\"?COLE\"James\"!  Nobody ever calls me that.RAILLY(frowns, studies him)Have you been a patient at County?Have I seen you someplace?COLENo, not possible.  Listen, I have toget out of here.  Im supposed to begetting information.RAILLYWhat kind of information?COLEIt wont help you.  You cant do anythingabout it.

POLICE STATION CORRIDOR - MORNINGCOLE, bound tightly by the strait-jacket, heavy manacles on hisankles, is being escorted down the corridor by two surly POLICEMEN.COLEWhere are you taking me?POLICEMAN #1South of France, buddy.  Fancy hotel.Youre gonna love it.COLESouth of France?!  I dont want to goto the South of France.  I want to makea telephone call.POLICEMAN #2 smirks as he unlocks a heavy steel door.POLICEMAN #2Zip it, scumbag -- you fooled the shrinkwith your act, but you dont fool us.Then, POLICEMAN #2 swings the steel door open and sunlightoverwhelms COLE, blinding him in a dazzling fury of white light.EXT.  CITY STREET/MINI-VAN - DAYA Mini-van, the kind of vehicle used to transport a half dozenprisoners, crawls through a busy street.  The Police Departmentlogo is prominent on the side of the van beneath barred windows.INT. COUNTY HOSPITAL/SHOWERS - AN HOUR LATER (MORNING)Fierce spray recalls the decontamination in the future.  COLEstands stark naked under the shower while two muscular attendants,PALMER and BILLINGS, supervise.As PALMER shuts off the water, BILLINGS hands COLE a towel andstarts inspecting his scalp...BILLINGSLemme see your head, Jimbo, see if yougot any creepy crawlies.COLEI need to make a telephone call.BILLINGS(pulling Coles head)Gotta work that out with a doctor, Jimbo.Cant make no calls til the doctor says.COLEIts very important.BILLINGSWhat chew gotta do, Jimbo, is take iteasy, relax into things.  We all gonnaget along fine if you just relax.COLE gets the hint of menace in the message and submits to thelice inspection, only his eyes revealing his frustration.INT.  HOSPITAL/DAYROOM - HALF AN HOUR LATER (DAY)COLE stands in the doorway, stunned by his first sight of thelarge room.  His eyes go to the heavily-grilled windows wherelight pours in from outside.  Then, to the TV, where a CARTOONCOMMERCIAL makes raucous noises.PATIENTS, in K-Mart street clothes or ratty robes, stare gloomilyat the TV, or play cards, pace, or just stare blankly.BILLINGS is at COLES side, beckoning to a patient, JEFFREY MASON,a twenty year old white youth dressed in khakis and a plaid shirt.BILLINGSJeffrey.  Yo!  Jeffrey.  This here is James.Whyncha show James around?  Tell him the TVrules, show him the games an stuff, okay?JEFFREY(with a sly look)How much you gonna pay me?  Huh?  Idbe doing your job.BILLINGSFive thousand dollars, my man.  Thatenough?  Ill wire it to your accountas usual, okay?JEFFREYOkay, Billings.  Five thousand.  Thatsenough.  Five thousand dollars.  Illgive him the Deluxe Mental Hospital Tour.As BILLINGS walks away chuckling, JEFFREY turns to COLE.JEFFREYKid around, kid around.  It makes them feelgood, were all pals.  Were prisoners, theyrethe guards, but its all in good fun, you see?COLE nods and JEFFREY indicates card tables where PATIENTS areplaying cards, checkers, chess, or working on jig saw puzzles.JEFFREYHeres the games.  Games vegitize you.If you play the games, yourevoluntarily taking a tranquilizer.COLE sees a partially completed puzzle of the well-known painting,THE PEACEABLE KINGDOM, depicting a serene world of animals in harmony.JEFFREYWhatd they give you?  Thorazine?  Howmuch?  Learn your drugs -- know your doses.COLEI need to make a telephone call.JEFFREYA telephone call?  Thats communicationwith the outside world!  Doctorsdiscretion.  Hey, if alla these nutscould just make phone calls, it couldspread.  Insanity oozing through telephonecables, oozing into the ears of all thosepoor sane people, infecting them!  Whackoseverywhere!  A plague of madness.(suddenly sly and confidential)In fact, very few of us here are actuallymentally ill.  Im not saying yourenot mentally ill, for all I know yourecrazy as a loon.  But thats not whyyoure here.  Why youre here is becauseof the system, because of the economy.(indicating the TV)Theres the TV.  Its all right there.Commercials.  We are not productiveanymore, they dont need us to makethings anymore, its all automated.  Whatare we for then?  Were consumers.  Okay,buy a lot of stuff, youre a good citizen.But if you dont buy a lot of stuff, youknow what?  Youre mentally ill! Thatsa fact!  If you dont buy things...toiletpaper, new cars, computerized blenders,electrically operated sexual devices...(getting hysterical)SCREWDRIVERS WITH MINIATURE BUILT-INRADAR DEVICES, STEREO SYSTEMS WITHBRAIN IMPLANTED HEADPHONES, VOICE-ACTIVATED COMPUTERS, AND...A woman orderly, TERRY, turns from the feeble PATIENT shes helping.TERRYTake it easy, Jeffrey.  Be calm.Abruptly, JEFFREY stifles his hysteria, takes a deep breath andcontinues, completely calm now.  But COLE isnt listening.  Hesmesmerized by the TV.JEFFREYSo if you want to watch a particularprogram, say \"All My Children\" orsomething, you go to the Charge Nurseand tell her what day and time the showyou want to see is on.  But you have totell her before the show is scheduledto be on.  There was this one guy whowas always requesting shows that had alreadyplayed.  He couldnt quite grasp theidea that the Charge Nurse couldntjust make it be yesterday for him, turnback time ha ha.  What a fruitcake!!This last thought actually penetrates COLES focus on the TV andhe turns to JEFFREY whos picking up speed again.JEFFREYSeriously, more and more people arebeing defined now as mentally ill.  Why?Because theyre not consuming on theirown.  But as patients, they beconeconsumers of mental health care.  Andthis gives the so-called sane people work!(hysteria again)WHOOO!  SHOCK THERAPY!  GROUP THERAPY!HALLUCINATIONS!  THERAPEUTIC DRUGS!IGGIDY DIGGIDY DIG!  PERFECT!  THESYSTEM IN HARMONY LIKE A BIG MACHINE...TERRYOkay, thats it, Jeffrey, youre gonnaget a shot.  I warned you...JEFFREY(calming himself, smiling)Right!  Right!  Carried away, heh heh.I got \"carried away\".  Explaining theworkings of...the institution.Just then, TJ WASHINGTON, a somber-looking African American in abathrobe, taps COLE on the shoulder.TJ WASHINGTONI dont really come from outer space.JEFFREYThis is TJ Washington, Jim -- hedoesnt really come from outer space.TJ WASHINGTONDont mock me, my friend.(to Cole)Its a condition of \"mental divergence\".I find myself on another planet, Ogo,part of an intellectual elite, preparingto subjugate barbarian hordes on Pluto.But even though its a totally convincingreality in every way...I can feel, breathe,hear...nevertheless, Ogo is actually aconstruct of my psyche.  I am mentallydivergent in that I am escaping certainunnamed realities that plague my lifehere.  When I stop going there, I willbe well.  Are you also divergent, friend?The P.A. SYSTEM interrupts, startling COLE.P.A. SYSTEM (v.o.)James Cole.  Report to Staff.  James Cole!JEFFREYStaff!  Whoo!  Time for Staff.  Now thegeniuses cure you.  Hallelujah!INT.  PSYCH WARD CONFERENCE ROOM - MINUTES LATER (DAY)COLE is agitated, speaking forcefully.COLEThis is a place for crazy people!

Theres beena mistake, Ive been sent to the wrong place.Suddenly, COLE reaches out and BILLINGS lunges forward, but COLEis just grabbing a pad and pencil.COLEHey, Im not going to hurt anybody.FLETCHER restrains BILLINGS with a hand signal.COLE(drawing)Do any of you know anything about theArmy of the Twelve Monkeys?  They paintthis, stencil it, on buildings, allover the place.COLE waves a sketch of the dancing monkey logo we saw earlier.DR. CASEYMr. Cole...COLERight.  I guess you wouldnt, this is1989, theyre probably not active yet.That makes sense!  Okay.  Listen to me,three billion people died in 1995.Three billion, got that?  Almostthe whole population.  Of the world!Only about one percent survived.DOCTORS exchange knowing looks.  This is an old story, apparently.RESIDENT #2Are you going to save us, Mr. Cole?COLESave you?  How can I save you?  Italready happened!  I cant save you.  Imsimply trying to get some information forpeople in the present so that someday...(sees their eyes)You dont believe me.  You think Imcrazy.  But Im not crazy.  Im a convict,sure, I have a quick temper, but Im assane as anyone in this room.  I...COLE stops, sees DR. FLETCHER tapping his pencil.  COLES seenthat tapping before -- in the future!  It disorients him.DR. RAILLYCan you tell us the name of the prisonyouve come from?COLE doesnt answer.  Hes staring at the tapping pencil.DR. FLETCHERDoes this bother you, Mr. Cole?COLE(recovering, new tack)No!  Look, I dont belong here!  What Ineed to do is make a telephone call tostraighten everything out.DR. FLETCHERWho would you call, Mr. Cole, who wouldstraighten everything out?COLEScientists.  Im supposed to report into them.  Theyll want to know theysent me to the wrong time.DR. FLETCHERSo you could talk to these scientistsand they do what?  Send you to the future?COLENo, no.  I cant talk to them.  Its called,\"voice mail\".  Im supposed to leave messages.They monitor it from the present.RESIDENT #2\"From the present.\"  Were not in thepresent now, Mr. Cole?COLENo, no.  This is the past.  This hasalready happened.  Listen...RESIDENT #3Mr. Cole, you belong in 1995 -- thatsthe present, is that it?COLENo, 1995 is the past, too.  Look...DR. FLETCHERThese scientists, Mr. Cole?  Are theydoctors like ourselves?Two of the residents exchange quick knowing looks.COLENo!  I mean yes, but... Look, Ive been givena lot of drugs but Im still perfectly lucid.You have to let me use the phone.  One call!COLE looks desperately toward RAILLY, pleading eyes meeting hers.INT.  LOW RENT APARTMENT - DAYFour little KIDS SCREAM and SQUABBLE while the phone CHIRPSinsistently in the tiny, cluttered apartment and a harried MOTHERlunges for the phone, answers sharply...MOTHERYes?(listens, frowns, then)Whaaaaat?  \"Voice mail\"!  I dont knowwhat youre talkin about. ... Is thisa joke?  I dont know any scientists.James who?  Never heard of you!The MOTHER slams down the phone.INT.  RAILLYS OFFICE/COUNTY HOSPITAL - DAYA dismayed COLE still has the receiver in his hand.  Sympathetically,RAILLY takes it from him.RAILLYIt wasnt who you expected?COLE is clearly agitated, starts to pace, upset.  Nuts?COLEIt was some lady.  She didnt know anything.RAILLYPerhaps it was a wrong number...COLENo.  Thats the reason they chose me --I remember things.RAILLY frowns, studying the distracted man with intense interest.Its clear COLE is becoming a special patient and RAILLYS cool,detached demeanor is giving way ever so slightly.RAILLYJames, where did you grow up?  Was itaround here?  Around Baltimore?COLE(lost in thought)What?RAILLYI have the...strangest feeling Ive metyou before...a long time ago, perhaps.Were you ever...?COLEWait!  This is only 1989!  Im supposedto be leaving messages in 1995.  Itsnot the right number yet.  Thats theproblem.  Damn!  How can I contact them?RAILLY recovers her distance, her poise, as she takes a bottle,pours out some tablets, and holds them out to COLE.RAILLYJames, take these.(watching him step back)Please -- I helped you like I said Iwould.  Now I want you to trust me.INT.  AIRPORT CONCOURSE - DAY (THE DREAM)MR. PONYTAIL races past the startled YOUNG COLE.MR. PONYTAILWATCH IT!Was it JEFFREY wearing gaudy pants and a ponytail?  It wasdefinitely JEFFREYS VOICE.TRAVELERS dive for cover as a WOMANS VOICE cries out...WOMANS VOICENOOOOOOOOOO!The TERRIFIED TRAVELER looks up at YOUNG COLE, makes eye contact, butdoesnt speak.  The TERRIFIED TRAVELER looks a lot like DR. FLETCHER!Just then, YOUNG COLE is distracted by a running figure.  Itsthe BLONDE MAN in the Hawaiian shirt, but hes not injured.

DORMITORY (PSYCH WARD)/COUNTY HOSPITAL - NIGHTCOLES eyes blink awake, blinded by a flashlight.Hes lying in one of thirty beds in a darkened ward.  Disoriented.Which world is this?  The room is full of BREATHING, SNORING,occasional MOANS.  He can barely discern the shadowy figures ofan ORDERLY and a NURSE, making their rounds, checking each bed.His eyes adjusting to the darkness, COLE watches them exit.He turns and sees a patch of moonlight coming in a barred window.With a quick glance at the sleeping PATIENTS, he slips out ofbed, makes his way stealthily to the window, peers out.COLES POV:  the moon, glowing in the sky, illuminating a singletree.  Under the tree, in silhouette, a COUPLE embraces, kisses.ANGLE ON COLE, looking out the window, absorbed.VOICE (o.s.)It wont work.

And all the doors arelocked, too.  Theyre protecting thepeople on the outside from us.  But thepeople outside are as crazy as us.COLE has become preoccupied with a small SPIDER creeping alongthe window sill.  Hes staring at it when hes distracted by asudden SOUND.  Grabbing the SPIDER, COLE scrambles back into bedjust as the door opens and an ORDERLY probes the dark room withthe blade of his flashlight.ANGLE ON COLE, in bed, feigning sleep.The flashlight clicks off and COLE hears the door close.For a long moment the ward is silent except for BREATHING,SNORES, occasional MOANS.  Then, COLE hears JEFFREYS hoarsewhisper, picking up right where he left off.JEFFREYYou know what \"crazy\" is?  \"crazy\" is\"majority rules\".  Take germs for example.Although COLE is preoccupied with the SPIDER struggling to getout of his fist, he cant help reacting to the word, \"germs\"!COLEGerms?!JEFFREYIn the 18th century there was no suchthing!  Nobodyd ever imagined such athing -- no sane person anyway.  Alongcomes this doctor...Semmelweiss, Ithink.  He tries to convince people...other doctors mostly...that there arethese teeny tiny invisible \"bad things\"called germs that get into your body andmake you...sick!  Hes trying to getdoctors to wash their hands.  What isthis guy...crazy?

Hegoes, \"I dont believe in germs.  Germsare just a plot they made up so theycan sell you disinfectants and soap!\"Now, hes crazy, right?  Hey, youbelieve in germs, dont you?COLEIm not crazy.JEFFREYOf course not, I never thought you were.You want to escape, right?  Thats verysane.  I can help you.  You want me to,dont you?

COLLEGE CAMPUS - NIGHTStunningly quiet.  We are on a placid campus looking at thedignified architecture of Breitrose Hall.

KATHRYN RAILLYMADNESS AND APOCALYPTIC VISIONSMAY 17INT.  AUDITORIUM/BREITROSE HALL - NIGHTA large screen dominates the auditorium stage.  On the screen isa slide of an engraving from the Middle Ages showing a MADMAN inapparent agony, his mouth shaped to a scream, as he is restrainedby PEASANTS.  The projector ZOOMS slowly in on the agonized FACEof this MADMAN as we HEAR RAILLYS VOICE lecturing.RAILLYS VOICE (o.s.)According to the accounts of localofficials at that time, this gentleman,judged to be about forty years of age,appeared suddenly in the village of Wylenear Stonehenge in the West of England inApril of 1162.  Using unfamiliar words andspeaking in a strange accent, the man madedire prognostications about a pestilencewhich he predicted would wipe out humanityin approximately 8OO years.  Deranged andhysterical, the man raped a young woman of thevillage, was taken into custody, but thenmysteriously escaped and was not heard of again.WE DISCOVER RAILLY, six years older now, standing at a lecternin a pool of light.  Shes dwarfed by the giant screen where theengraving is replaced by a series of slides of woodcuts showingscenes of pestilence in the Middle Ages as she lectures to anaudience of mostly SCHOLARLY TYPES.RAILLY (cont.)In 1841, Mackay wrote, \"During seasonsof great pestilence, men have oftenbelieved the prophecies of crazedfanatics, that the end of the world wascome.\"  Obviously, this plague/doomsdayscenario is considerably more compellingwhen reality supports it in some form,whether its the Bubonic Plague, smallpox,or AIDS.  In addition to these \"natural\"contagions, there are now technologicalhorrors as well:  besides radiation,consider our lurking fear of germwarfare and its close approximation,chemical warfare, which first rearedits ugly head in the deadly mustardgas attacks during the First World War.ON THE SCREEN, a SERIES of SLIDES show images of WORLD WAR ISOLDIERS in gas masks, in death throes, etc..RAILLYS VOICE (cont. o.s.)During such an attack in the Frenchtrenches in October, 1917, we have anaccount of this soldier...ON THE SCREEN, a slide of an old deteriorated photograph showsJOSE, the Puerto Rican kid, strapped to a stretcher, being carriedby SOLDIERS through the trenches during an attack.  JOSE appearsto be ranting madly as the projector ZOOMS CLOSER on his face untilthe image approximates Munchs famous painting.RAILLYS VOICE (cant. o.s.)-- who, during an assault, was woundedby shrapnel and hospitalized behind thelines where Doctors discovered he hadlost all comprehension of French butspoke English fluently, albeit in aregional dialect they didnt recognize.The man, although physically unaffectedby the gas, was hysterical.  He claimedhe had come from the future, that he waslooking for a pure germ that wouldultimately wipe mankind off the face ofthe earth in the year... 1995!The AUDIENCE gives a nervous CHUCKLE.ON THE SCREEN, a different old photograph of JOSE.  This timehes in a military hospital, gaunt, haunted, very ill.RAILLYS VOICE (cont. o.s.)Although seriously injured, the youngsoldier disappeared from the hospitalbefore more data could be gathered.  Nodoubt, he was trying to carry on hismission to warn others, substitutingfor the agony of war...a self-inflictedagony we call the \"Cassandra Complex\".As RAILLY continues, we SCAN the AUDIENCE and DISCOVER MARILOU MARTIN,RAILLYS friend, and MARILOUS HUSBAND, WAYNE CHANG, both listeningattentively.  Further away, another MAN listens intently.  A MAN withshoulder-length carrot-colored hair.  His name is DR. PETERS.RAILLY (cont.)Cassandra, in Greek legend you will recall,was condemned to know the future but to bedisbelieved when she foretold it.  Hence,the agony of foreknowledge combined withimpotence to do anything about it.INT.  RECEPTION ROOM - AN HOUR LATER (NIGHT)A stack of new books.  THE DOOMSDAY SYNDROME, ApocalypticVisions of the Mentally Ill by Dr. Kathryn RaillySurrounded by enthusiastic members of the audience, RAILLY isseated at the table signing books but DR. PETERS has her ear.DR. PETERSI think, Dr. Railly, you have givenyour alarmists a bad name.  Surelythere is very real and very convincingdata that the planet cannot survive theexcesses of the human race:  proliferationof atomic devices, uncontrolled breedinghabits, the rape of the environment, thepollution of land, sea, and air.  In thiscontext, isnt it obvious that \"ChickenLittle\" represents the sane vision andthat Homo Sapiens motto, \"Lets goshopping!\" is the cry of the true lunatic?DR. PETERS smiles self-importantly at RAILLY as an elderlydisheveled PROFESSOR elbows in front of him. DISHEVELED PROFESSORDoctor Railly -- please!  I wonder ifyoure aware of my own studies whichindicate that certain cycles of themoon actually impact on the incidenceof apocalyptic predictions as observedin urban emergency rooms and...As the PROFESSOR babbles, MARILOU MARTIN and her husband, WAYNECHANG, appear and whisper...MARILOUYou were great.RAILLYYoure leaving?MARILOUThe reservations at nine thirty --its getting late.DISHEVELED PROFESSORDoctor Railly -- please -- this is veryimportant!WAYNE CHANG(checking the professor)You sure youre gonna be all right?RAILLY(smiles, checks her watch)Ill be there in twenty minutes.DISHEVELED PROFESSORDr. Railly, I simply cannot understandyour exclusion of the moon in relationto apocalyptic dementia...EXT.

His face is lost in darknessbut she glimpses ragged, torn clothing as he tries to read themap by the intermittent glow of passing street lights.RAILLYWhere... where are we goingMANI need you to drive me to Philadelphia.RAILLY(startled, horrified)But thats... thats more than 200 miles!MANThats why I cant walk there.  Turnhere... I think...RAILLY obeys.  She glances in the mirror again, hesitates, thenboldly switches on the dome light, holding her breath fearfullyfor his reaction.He grunts appreciatively.  Relieved, she looks in the mirroragain, trying to get a better look at him, but now his featuresare concealed by the map.RAILLYIf you make me go with you, itskidnapping.  Thats a serious crime.If you let me go, you could just takethe car and...MANI dont know how to drive!  We wentunderground when I was nine, I told youthat.

Sorry about that.But then I saw your book in a store windowwith a notice about your lecture.(sudden pride)I can read, remember?RAILLYYes, I remember.(a beat, then)Why do you want to go to Philadelphia?COLEIts the next step.  I checked out theBaltimore information, it was nothing.Its Philadelphia, thats where theyare, the ones who killed everyone.(pointing suddenly, eagerly)Zs that a radio?  Does it play music?RAILLY turns on the radio and immediately WE HEAR the SOUND of SURFand the CRIES of gulls, background to an oozing baritone COMMERCIAL.COMMERCIAL/RADIO (o.s.)This is a personal message to you.COLE sits up, alert, listening intently.COMMERCIAL/RADIO (cont. o.s.)Are you at the end of your rope?  Areyou dying to get away?COLES eyes narrow, concentrating on this personal message.COMMERCAIL/RADIO (cont. o.s.}The Florida Keys are waiting for you.COLE frowns as the SOUND of breaking SURF and crying GULLS fillsthe car.

He blinks in the near dark, shaken, disoriented.Then, as he \"recovers\" from his very vivid dream, WE GET OURFIRST LOOK AT HIS ENVIRONMENT...A WINDOWLESS UNDERGROUND WORLD OFETERNAL NIGHT SOMETIME IN THE FUTURE...AN ALMOST COLORLESS\"REALITY\" OF BLURRED EDGES AND ECHOEY SOUNDS, MUCH MORE\"DREAMLIKE\" THAN HIS DREAM.Flashlights glare. In the half-light, COLE sees spooky figures,GUARDS, moving among the locked bunk/cages.COLE turns and whispers to the occupant of the next cage, JOSE...COLESsssst!  Jose, whats going on?JOSEs face is almost lost in shadow.  What there is of it isyouthful.  Hes just a scared Puerto Rican kid!JOSE\"Volunteers\" again.JOSE immediately rolls over and feigns sleep as SCARFACE, amenacing guard with a jagged scar running down his cheek, loomsclose to COLEs cage and unlocks it.SCARFACE\"Volunteer duty\".    The PRISONERS in the other cages watch silently with narrowed eyes.COLEI didnt volunteer.SCARFACEYou causing trouble again?COLE(controls his temper)No trouble.INT.

SEALED CHAMBER - MINUTES LATER (ETERNAL NIGHT)COLE, wearing the \"space suit\" and a helmet with a plastic visor,steps into a tiny chamber, a kind of air lock.  The heavy doorclangs shut behind him.  Hes alone.  COLES breath comes quickernow as he sucks oxygen from the air tanks on his back.On the opposite wall is another door with a huge wheel lock.COLE turns the heavy wheel, opens the door, steps through ItINT.  ELEVATOR - SECONDS LATER (ETERNAL NIGHT)COLES in an ascending elevator that groans and creaks.  He looksdown at a crudely drawn map he holds in his gloved hand.The map shows a series of tunnels and ladders.INT.  SEWER PIPE - MINUTES LATER (NIGHT)COLE pans a flashlight, probing the filthy sewer hes wading throughRATS flee the blade of light, scurry across islands of rusting junk.The flashlight beam settles on a ladder mounted in the wall.Reaching the rusted ladder, COLE starts to climb awkwardly.EXT.  CITY STREET/FUTURE - MOMENTS LATER (NIGHT)A SCRAPING NOISE as a heavy man-hole cover is pushed up and movedaside.  COLES helmeted head emerges from below.COLES POV THROUGH HIS PLASTIC-VISORED HELMET:  a city inmoonlight!  A surreal image of abandoned buildings.  No peopleanywhere.  The only sounds are the WIND and COLES BREATHING.EXT.  ANOTHER CITY STREET - MINUTES LATER (NIGHT)COLES light reveals abandoned vine-covered automobiles.Moving to the nearest car, COLE searches in the vines forsomething.  Finds it.  An insect.COLE takes the bug in his gloved hand.  As he clumsily inserts itinto a collection tube, something makes him turn.Theres something across the street in the dark.  Something alive.COLE points his flashlight and reveals...a BEAR!  Startled by thelight, the animal blinks, then stands on its rear legs and ROARS.ANGLE ON COLE, staring wide-eyed.Then, the BEAR sinks down onto all fours and, trying to avoid theflashlight, it pads quickly down the street.INT.  SUBTERRANEAN PARKING GARAGE - NIGHTUsing the flashlight to see, COLE reaches down to the crackedfloor and gets another specimen.  DOGSHIT!The only sound is COLES labored BREATHING.Then, a different SOUND.  GRRRR!  A dog.  More GRRRRS.  Moredogs.  Then, a YIP.  Then, VICIOUS GROWLS.  Its a DOGFIGHT!EXT.  STREET - NIGHT (FIRST LIGHT)A giant OWL, perched on an overhead traffic light, raises its wingsand lifts off...rising higher and higher into the brightening sky.Below, on the street, COLE trudges along, passing desertedbuildings, windows broken, rusted signs dangling.INT.  DEPARTMENT STORE - NIGHT (FIRST LIGHT)COLES light reveals a spider web just inside the store.  A largeSPIDER tries to hide from the light.COLE reaches carefully into the web and plucks the spider andputs it into one of his specimen tubes.Then, he shines his light all around the once elegant store.  Theresnothing but aisle after aisle of moldering consumer goods.EXT.  DEPARTMENT STORE - DAWNAs COLE comes out of the store, the first rays of the sun hit thebuilding.  COLE stops, squints into the light through his visor.COLES POV:  spray-painted on the wall a long time ago is a stenciledlogo of twelve monkeys holding hands in a circle.  Over it iswritten, \"WE DID IT!\"COLE looks up.COLES POV:  high up on a building across the street, a LIONpatrols a ledge, pauses, looks out majestically over his world.TTTLES ENDINT.  FIRST UNDERGROUND DECONTAMINATION CHAMBER - ETERNAL NIGHTROARING WATER, powerful torrents gushing from nozzles in thewall, pummel the still-suited COLE.INT.  SECOND UNDERGROUND DECONTAMINATION CHAMBER - ETERNAL NIGHTStark naked and shivering, COLE is being scrubbed with brushes onlong poles (like the ones used to wash cars) wielded by two HULKINGFIGURES in bulky decontamination suits, their personas lost in theirwindowed masks.  Its a grim scene in a grim cement room with damp,dripping walls.  From an unseen source comes an AMPLIFIED VOICE,AMPLIFIED VOICE (o.s.)Raise your arms above your head.COLE lifts his arms and the FIGURES start scrubbing his armpits.INT.  TINY CHAMBER - SHORTLY (ETERNAL NIGHT)Still naked, COLE is seated on a stool while a MASKED TECHNICIANin a less elaborate, less bulky decontamination outfit drawsblood from COLES arm with an old-fashioned hypodermic needle.COLE glances toward a single, nearly opaque \"window\" of thickplastic in the rusty iron wall.  VAGUE FIGURES seem to lurkbehind the translucent aperture, studying him.The TECHNICIAN slips the blood sample through a slot in the wall.INT.  ENGINEERING OFFICE/FUTURE WORLD - ETERNAL NIGHTUshered in by two guards, TINY and SCARFACE, COLE looks around.COLES POV:  wails hidden by old headlines, articles, maps, charts...a blackboard covered with elaborate, sophisticated formulae...surfacesheaped with cracked monitors, gerry-rigged computers held together withstring, lasers lost in tangles of cable, ancient tube amplifiers, adilapidated cardboard reconstruction of a city, stacks of molderingbooks and tattered computer printouts...and, seated at a long conferencetable, staring at COLE, six SCIENTISTS:  an ASTROPHYSICIST, ENGINEER,BOTANIST, MICROBIOLOGIST, ZOOLOGIST, and a GEOLOGIST.  They representa \"modern\" science where brilliant new ideas interface with crude,outdated, patched-together technologies.TINYJames Cole.  Cleared from quarantine.MICROBIOLOGISTThank you.

Yourenot going to hurt us, are you Mr. Cole?COLES head turns quickly to the ENGINEER.COLENo, sir.The GUARDS exchange a look, shrug, exit, closing the door.MICROBIOLOGISTWhy dont you sit down, Mr. Cole.COLE goes to the empty chair at the conference table, sits down.ASTROPHYSICISTWe want you to tell us about lastnight.COLEI went to the surface and I collectedspecimens like I was told.The SCIENTISTS dont say anything.  They just study him carefully.COLE(worried)I mashed the spider, didnt I?MICROBIOLOGISTWell get to the spider later, Mr.Cole.  Right now, we want to knoweverything that you saw.INT.  ENGINEERING OFFICE - AN HOUR LATER (ETERNAL NIGHT)COLE, starting to look very tired now, stands at the blackboardsketching a detailed map of exactly where he was last night.ASTPOPHYSICISTWhere you collected sample #4, whatstreet was that?COLEUh...BOTANISTIts important to observe everything.COLEI think it was...Im sure it was 2nd Street.As the SCIENTISTS start to whisper animatedly among themselves,COLES eyes drift across the newspaper clippings taped to thewall.  One headline screams, \"VIRUS MUTATING!\"  Another featuresa photo of an OLD MAN (DR.

SYSTEM (o.s.)Flight 784 now boarding at gate...Suddenly, a SHOUT, followed by raised VOICES, interrupts themonotonous airport routine.  As YOUNG COLE and his PARENTS turnto see whats going on, a man well call MR. PONYTAIL, his faceaverted, hurries past them, bumping YOUNG COLE with a ChicagoHulls Sports Duffle Bag.MR. PONYTAILWATCH IT!YOUNG COLE sees little more than the gaudy pants, the duffle, andthe mans ponytail flopping as he rushes towards the gates.Just then, a WOMANS VOICE cries out, \"NOOOOOOOOO!\"YOUNG COLE turns back toward the Security Check Point just asTRAVELERS scatter madly, some diving to the floor, othersrunning.  A TERRIFIED TRAVELER, hitting the floor close by, looksup at YOUNG COLE with panicky eyes, and asks....TERRIFIED TRAVELERJust exactly why did you volunteer?INT.  ENGINEERING OFFICE/FUTURE WORLD - (ETERNAL NIGHT)COLE comes abruptly awake.

He told meI volunteered.The SCIENTISTS react, whispering urgently among themselves.COLE starts to nod off again, then comes awake with a start asthe ENGINEER speaks to him.ENGINEERWe appreciate you volunteering.  Yourea very good observer, Cole.COLEUh, thank you.ENGINEERYoull get a reduction in sentence.COLE keeps his face impassive.ASTROPHYSICISTTo be determined by the proper authorities.ENGINEERYou dont want to jeopardize that reduction,do you, Cole?

A POET, tiny and ruddy faced, squints over hisglasses as he reads in a booming voice to an AUDIENCE of thirtyseated on folding chairs.POETStill among the myriad microwaves, theinfra-red messages, the gigabytes of onesand zeroes, we find words, infinitesimallysmall, byte-sized now, tinier even thanscience lurking in some vague electricitywhere, if we listen we can hear the solitaryvoice of that poet telling us,\"We are no other than a moving rowOf Magic shadow-shapes that come and goRound with the Sun-illumined Lantern holdIn Midnight by the Master of the show.\"As the POET reads, we STUDY the audience, mostly YUPPIE CULTUREJUNKIES or BOHEMIANS.  Among them, a light-haired woman of twenty-eight, soberly dressed, wearing glasses.  Shes KATHRYN RAILLY.  Andits her beeper that suddenly BEEPS.  BEEP!

BEEP!  Scowling at the outrageous interruption, the POETlooks up from the text just as RAILLY, tumbling, shuts off thebeeper and rises, embarrassed.  As she makes her way to an exit,the glaring POET continues...POET\"Yesterday This Days Madness did prepare;Tomorrows Silence, Triumph or Despair:Drink!  for you know not whence you came, nor why:Drink!  for you know not why you go, nor where.\"INT.  CORRIDOR/POLICE STATION - NIGHTDETECTIVE FRANKI leads RAILLY past crowded holding cells.FRANKI-- so they get there and they ask the guyreal nice for some kind of i.d., and he getsagitated, starts screaming about viruses.Totally irrational, totally disoriented,doesnt know where he is, what day it is,alla that stuff.  All they got was hisname.  They figure hes stoned out ofhis mind, its some kinda psychoticepisode, so theyre gonna bring him...RAILLYHes been tested for drugs?FRANKINegative for drugs.  But he took onfive cops like he was dusted to theeyeballs.  No drugs.  You believe that?FRANKI pauses, indicating a tiny observation window of thick meshedglass in an otherwise solid door, and RAILLY looks through it.RAILLYS POV THROUGH THE WINDOW:  a MAN, his back to her, instrait-jacket and prison denims, examining the wall of the paddedcell with the distorted intensity of a \"mental case\".RAILLYYou have him in restraints.FRANKIWere you listening?  We got two officers inthe hospital.  Yeah, hes in restraints, plusthe medic gave him enough stellazine to killa horse.  Look at him!  Still on his feet.RAILLYS POV THROUGH THE WINDOW:  the MAN in the cell turns, looksright at her.  In spite of the cuts and welts, its clearly COLE.RAILLYThat would explain the bruises, Iguess.  The struggle.FRANKIYou want to go in?  Examine him?RAILLYYes, please.  You said he gave a name...FRANKI(unlocking the door)James Cole.  Thats everything we got.

POLICE STATION CORRIDOR - MORNINGCOLE, bound tightly by the strait-jacket, heavy manacles on hisankles, is being escorted down the corridor by two surly POLICEMEN.COLEWhere are you taking me?POLICEMAN #1South of France, buddy.  Fancy hotel.Youre gonna love it.COLESouth of France?!  I dont want to goto the South of France.  I want to makea telephone call.POLICEMAN #2 smirks as he unlocks a heavy steel door.POLICEMAN #2Zip it, scumbag -- you fooled the shrinkwith your act, but you dont fool us.Then, POLICEMAN #2 swings the steel door open and sunlightoverwhelms COLE, blinding him in a dazzling fury of white light.EXT.

The Police Departmentlogo is prominent on the side of the van beneath barred windows.INT. COUNTY HOSPITAL/SHOWERS - AN HOUR LATER (MORNING)Fierce spray recalls the decontamination in the future.  COLEstands stark naked under the shower while two muscular attendants,PALMER and BILLINGS, supervise.As PALMER shuts off the water, BILLINGS hands COLE a towel andstarts inspecting his scalp...BILLINGSLemme see your head, Jimbo, see if yougot any creepy crawlies.COLEI need to make a telephone call.BILLINGS(pulling Coles head)Gotta work that out with a doctor, Jimbo.Cant make no calls til the doctor says.COLEIts very important.BILLINGSWhat chew gotta do, Jimbo, is take iteasy, relax into things.  We all gonnaget along fine if you just relax.COLE gets the hint of menace in the message and submits to thelice inspection, only his eyes revealing his frustration.INT.  HOSPITAL/DAYROOM - HALF AN HOUR LATER (DAY)COLE stands in the doorway, stunned by his first sight of thelarge room.  His eyes go to the heavily-grilled windows wherelight pours in from outside.  Then, to the TV, where a CARTOONCOMMERCIAL makes raucous noises.PATIENTS, in K-Mart street clothes or ratty robes, stare gloomilyat the TV, or play cards, pace, or just stare blankly.BILLINGS is at COLES side, beckoning to a patient, JEFFREY MASON,a twenty year old white youth dressed in khakis and a plaid shirt.BILLINGSJeffrey.  Yo!  Jeffrey.  This here is James.Whyncha show James around?  Tell him the TVrules, show him the games an stuff, okay?JEFFREY(with a sly look)How much you gonna pay me?  Huh?  Idbe doing your job.BILLINGSFive thousand dollars, my man.  Thatenough?  Ill wire it to your accountas usual, okay?JEFFREYOkay, Billings.  Five thousand.  Thatsenough.  Five thousand dollars.  Illgive him the Deluxe Mental Hospital Tour.As BILLINGS walks away chuckling, JEFFREY turns to COLE.JEFFREYKid around, kid around.  It makes them feelgood, were all pals.  Were prisoners, theyrethe guards, but its all in good fun, you see?COLE nods and JEFFREY indicates card tables where PATIENTS areplaying cards, checkers, chess, or working on jig saw puzzles.JEFFREYHeres the games.  Games vegitize you.If you play the games, yourevoluntarily taking a tranquilizer.COLE sees a partially completed puzzle of the well-known painting,THE PEACEABLE KINGDOM, depicting a serene world of animals in harmony.JEFFREYWhatd they give you?  Thorazine?  Howmuch?  Learn your drugs -- know your doses.COLEI need to make a telephone call.JEFFREYA telephone call?  Thats communicationwith the outside world!  Doctorsdiscretion.  Hey, if alla these nutscould just make phone calls, it couldspread.  Insanity oozing through telephonecables, oozing into the ears of all thosepoor sane people, infecting them!  Whackoseverywhere!  A plague of madness.(suddenly sly and confidential)In fact, very few of us here are actuallymentally ill.  Im not saying yourenot mentally ill, for all I know yourecrazy as a loon.  But thats not whyyoure here.  Why youre here is becauseof the system, because of the economy.(indicating the TV)Theres the TV.  Its all right there.Commercials.  We are not productiveanymore, they dont need us to makethings anymore, its all automated.  Whatare we for then?  Were consumers.  Okay,buy a lot of stuff, youre a good citizen.But if you dont buy a lot of stuff, youknow what?  Youre mentally ill! Thatsa fact!  If you dont buy things...toiletpaper, new cars, computerized blenders,electrically operated sexual devices...(getting hysterical)SCREWDRIVERS WITH MINIATURE BUILT-INRADAR DEVICES, STEREO SYSTEMS WITHBRAIN IMPLANTED HEADPHONES, VOICE-ACTIVATED COMPUTERS, AND...A woman orderly, TERRY, turns from the feeble PATIENT shes helping.TERRYTake it easy, Jeffrey.  Be calm.Abruptly, JEFFREY stifles his hysteria, takes a deep breath andcontinues, completely calm now.  But COLE isnt listening.  Hesmesmerized by the TV.JEFFREYSo if you want to watch a particularprogram, say \"All My Children\" orsomething, you go to the Charge Nurseand tell her what day and time the showyou want to see is on.  But you have totell her before the show is scheduledto be on.  There was this one guy whowas always requesting shows that had alreadyplayed.  He couldnt quite grasp theidea that the Charge Nurse couldntjust make it be yesterday for him, turnback time ha ha.  What a fruitcake!!This last thought actually penetrates COLES focus on the TV andhe turns to JEFFREY whos picking up speed again.JEFFREYSeriously, more and more people arebeing defined now as mentally ill.  Why?Because theyre not consuming on theirown.  But as patients, they beconeconsumers of mental health care.  Andthis gives the so-called sane people work!(hysteria again)WHOOO!  SHOCK THERAPY!  GROUP THERAPY!HALLUCINATIONS!  THERAPEUTIC DRUGS!IGGIDY DIGGIDY DIG!  PERFECT!  THESYSTEM IN HARMONY LIKE A BIG MACHINE...TERRYOkay, thats it, Jeffrey, youre gonnaget a shot.  I warned you...JEFFREY(calming himself, smiling)Right!  Right!  Carried away, heh heh.I got \"carried away\".  Explaining theworkings of...the institution.Just then, TJ WASHINGTON, a somber-looking African American in abathrobe, taps COLE on the shoulder.TJ WASHINGTONI dont really come from outer space.JEFFREYThis is TJ Washington, Jim -- hedoesnt really come from outer space.TJ WASHINGTONDont mock me, my friend.(to Cole)Its a condition of \"mental divergence\".I find myself on another planet, Ogo,part of an intellectual elite, preparingto subjugate barbarian hordes on Pluto.But even though its a totally convincingreality in every way...I can feel, breathe,hear...nevertheless, Ogo is actually aconstruct of my psyche.  I am mentallydivergent in that I am escaping certainunnamed realities that plague my lifehere.  When I stop going there, I willbe well.  Are you also divergent, friend?The P.A. SYSTEM interrupts, startling COLE.P.A. SYSTEM (v.o.)James Cole.  Report to Staff.  James Cole!JEFFREYStaff!  Whoo!  Time for Staff.  Now thegeniuses cure you.  Hallelujah!INT.  PSYCH WARD CONFERENCE ROOM - MINUTES LATER (DAY)COLE is agitated, speaking forcefully.COLEThis is a place for crazy people!  Imnot crazy!RAILLY, four other PSYCHIATRIC RESIDENTS, including RAILLYS bestfriend, MARILOU MARTIN, and their chief, DR. OWEN FLETCHER, sitaround a beat-up conference table, watching COLE, who sits facingthe doctors, with BILLINGS looming behind him.  (Some of the DOCTORSbear a strong resemblance to the SCIENTISTS OF THE FUTURE.)RESIDENT #1We dont use that term...\"crazy\", Mr. Cole.COLEWell, youve got some real nuts in here!Listen to me, all of you -- I have totell you something thats going to bedifficult for you to understand, but...DR.

Do youknow what year it is right now?COLE1989.  Look, Im not confused.  Theres beena mistake, Ive been sent to the wrong place.Suddenly, COLE reaches out and BILLINGS lunges forward, but COLEis just grabbing a pad and pencil.COLEHey, Im not going to hurt anybody.FLETCHER restrains BILLINGS with a hand signal.COLE(drawing)Do any of you know anything about theArmy of the Twelve Monkeys?  They paintthis, stencil it, on buildings, allover the place.COLE waves a sketch of the dancing monkey logo we saw earlier.DR. CASEYMr. Cole...COLERight.  I guess you wouldnt, this is1989, theyre probably not active yet.That makes sense!  Okay.  Listen to me,three billion people died in 1995.Three billion, got that?  Almostthe whole population.  Of the world!Only about one percent survived.DOCTORS exchange knowing looks.  This is an old story, apparently.RESIDENT #2Are you going to save us, Mr. Cole?COLESave you?  How can I save you?  Italready happened!  I cant save you.  Imsimply trying to get some information forpeople in the present so that someday...(sees their eyes)You dont believe me.  You think Imcrazy.  But Im not crazy.  Im a convict,sure, I have a quick temper, but Im assane as anyone in this room.  I...COLE stops, sees DR. FLETCHER tapping his pencil.  COLES seenthat tapping before -- in the future!  It disorients him.DR. RAILLYCan you tell us the name of the prisonyouve come from?COLE doesnt answer.  Hes staring at the tapping pencil.DR. FLETCHERDoes this bother you, Mr. Cole?COLE(recovering, new tack)No!  Look, I dont belong here!  What Ineed to do is make a telephone call tostraighten everything out.DR. FLETCHERWho would you call, Mr. Cole, who wouldstraighten everything out?COLEScientists.  Im supposed to report into them.  Theyll want to know theysent me to the wrong time.DR. FLETCHERSo you could talk to these scientistsand they do what?  Send you to the future?COLENo, no.  I cant talk to them.  Its called,\"voice mail\".  Im supposed to leave messages.They monitor it from the present.RESIDENT #2\"From the present.\"  Were not in thepresent now, Mr. Cole?COLENo, no.  This is the past.  This hasalready happened.  Listen...RESIDENT #3Mr. Cole, you belong in 1995 -- thatsthe present, is that it?COLENo, 1995 is the past, too.  Look...DR. FLETCHERThese scientists, Mr. Cole?  Are theydoctors like ourselves?Two of the residents exchange quick knowing looks.COLENo!  I mean yes, but... Look, Ive been givena lot of drugs but Im still perfectly lucid.You have to let me use the phone.  One call!COLE looks desperately toward RAILLY, pleading eyes meeting hers.INT.  LOW RENT APARTMENT - DAYFour little KIDS SCREAM and SQUABBLE while the phone CHIRPSinsistently in the tiny, cluttered apartment and a harried MOTHERlunges for the phone, answers sharply...MOTHERYes?(listens, frowns, then)Whaaaaat?  \"Voice mail\"!  I dont knowwhat youre talkin about. ... Is thisa joke?  I dont know any scientists.James who?  Never heard of you!The MOTHER slams down the phone.INT.  RAILLYS OFFICE/COUNTY HOSPITAL - DAYA dismayed COLE still has the receiver in his hand.

She didnt know anything.RAILLYPerhaps it was a wrong number...COLENo.  Thats the reason they chose me --I remember things.RAILLY frowns, studying the distracted man with intense interest.Its clear COLE is becoming a special patient and RAILLYS cool,detached demeanor is giving way ever so slightly.RAILLYJames, where did you grow up?  Was itaround here?  Around Baltimore?COLE(lost in thought)What?RAILLYI have the...strangest feeling Ive metyou before...a long time ago, perhaps.Were you ever...?COLEWait!  This is only 1989!

How can I contact them?RAILLY recovers her distance, her poise, as she takes a bottle,pours out some tablets, and holds them out to COLE.RAILLYJames, take these.(watching him step back)Please -- I helped you like I said Iwould.

DORMITORY (PSYCH WARD)/COUNTY HOSPITAL - NIGHTCOLES eyes blink awake, blinded by a flashlight.Hes lying in one of thirty beds in a darkened ward.  Disoriented.Which world is this?  The room is full of BREATHING, SNORING,occasional MOANS.  He can barely discern the shadowy figures ofan ORDERLY and a NURSE, making their rounds, checking each bed.His eyes adjusting to the darkness, COLE watches them exit.He turns and sees a patch of moonlight coming in a barred window.With a quick glance at the sleeping PATIENTS, he slips out ofbed, makes his way stealthily to the window, peers out.COLES POV:  the moon, glowing in the sky, illuminating a singletree.  Under the tree, in silhouette, a COUPLE embraces, kisses.ANGLE ON COLE, looking out the window, absorbed.VOICE (o.s.)It wont work.

And all the doors arelocked, too.  Theyre protecting thepeople on the outside from us.  But thepeople outside are as crazy as us.COLE has become preoccupied with a small SPIDER creeping alongthe window sill.  Hes staring at it when hes distracted by asudden SOUND.  Grabbing the SPIDER, COLE scrambles back into bedjust as the door opens and an ORDERLY probes the dark room withthe blade of his flashlight.ANGLE ON COLE, in bed, feigning sleep.The flashlight clicks off and COLE hears the door close.For a long moment the ward is silent except for BREATHING,SNORES, occasional MOANS.  Then, COLE hears JEFFREYS hoarsewhisper, picking up right where he left off.JEFFREYYou know what \"crazy\" is?  \"crazy\" is\"majority rules\".  Take germs for example.Although COLE is preoccupied with the SPIDER struggling to getout of his fist, he cant help reacting to the word, \"germs\"!COLEGerms?!JEFFREYIn the 18th century there was no suchthing!  Nobodyd ever imagined such athing -- no sane person anyway.  Alongcomes this doctor...Semmelweiss, Ithink.  He tries to convince people...other doctors mostly...that there arethese teeny tiny invisible \"bad things\"called germs that get into your body andmake you...sick!  Hes trying to getdoctors to wash their hands.  What isthis guy...crazy?  Teeny tiny invisiblewhaddayou call em?...\"germs\"!As JEFFREY warms to his subject, getting excited, COLE tries tofigure out where to put the SPIDER.JEFFREY (cont.)So cut to the 20th century!  Last weekin fact, right before I got draggedinto this hellhole.  I order a burgerin this fast food joint.  The waiterdrops it on the floor.  He picks it up,wipes it off, hands it to me...like itwas all okay.No alternative.  COLE pops the SPIDER in his mouth and swallowsit as JEFFREY prattles on...JEFFREY\"What about the germs?\"  I say.  Hegoes, \"I dont believe in germs.  Germsare just a plot they made up so theycan sell you disinfectants and soap!\"Now, hes crazy, right?  Hey, youbelieve in germs, dont you?COLEIm not crazy.JEFFREYOf course not, I never thought you were.You want to escape, right?  Thats verysane.  I can help you.  You want me to,dont you?  Get you out?COLEIf you know how to escape, why dont you...?JEFFREYWhy dont I escape, thats what youwere going to ask me, right?  CauseId be crazy to escape!  Im all takencare of, see?

He looks down at the key in his hand.ANGLE ON JEFFREY, being grabbed by the ORDERLIES.  JEFFREYresists wildly as they struggle to overpower him.JEFFREYLAST CHANCE!  LAST CHANCE!  HEY -- OW!ANGLE ON COLE, moving to the door.  He reaches it and tries toinsert the key in the lock.ANGLE ON LOCK, as the key keeps missing the hole.ANGLE ON COLE, glancing nervously over his shoulder.COLES POV:  ORDERLIES swarm over JEFFREY, dont notice COLE.ANGLE ON COLE, managing to insert the key.  It wont turn.A PATIENT, close at hand, startles COLE, speaking into his ear.PATIENTPlace to go would be...Florida.

CORRIDOR/COUNTY HOSPITALStepping through the door, COLE finds himself in an ante-roomfacing several elevators.A uniformed SECURITY MAN sitting at a near-by desk doesnt evenlock up from the magazine hes reading.Barely daring to breathe, COLE steps toward the elevators so hisback is to the SECURITY MAN.  But he doesnt know how to controlthis elevator.  What should he do?SECURITY MANS VOICE (o.s.)Twos not working today.  Use one.COLE freezes, sneaks a glance over his shoulder.COLES POV:  the SECURITY MAN continues his reading.  Hes a bigguy with reading glasses perched on his nose.  He looks exactlylike the MENACING GUARD IN THE FUTURE...SCARFACE!ANGLE ON COLE, stunned!Just then, an elevator door slides open.  The elevators empty.COLE steps into it.INT.  ELEVATOR/COUNTY HOSPITALThe door closes, isolating COLE in the elevator.COLE finds the down button, is about to push it when the elevatorsprings to life.

COLLEGE CAMPUS - NIGHTStunningly quiet.  We are on a placid campus looking at thedignified architecture of Breitrose Hall.

KATHRYN RAILLYMADNESS AND APOCALYPTIC VISIONSMAY 17INT.  AUDITORIUM/BREITROSE HALL - NIGHTA large screen dominates the auditorium stage.  On the screen isa slide of an engraving from the Middle Ages showing a MADMAN inapparent agony, his mouth shaped to a scream, as he is restrainedby PEASANTS.  The projector ZOOMS slowly in on the agonized FACEof this MADMAN as we HEAR RAILLYS VOICE lecturing.RAILLYS VOICE (o.s.)According to the accounts of localofficials at that time, this gentleman,judged to be about forty years of age,appeared suddenly in the village of Wylenear Stonehenge in the West of England inApril of 1162.  Using unfamiliar words andspeaking in a strange accent, the man madedire prognostications about a pestilencewhich he predicted would wipe out humanityin approximately 8OO years.  Deranged andhysterical, the man raped a young woman of thevillage, was taken into custody, but thenmysteriously escaped and was not heard of again.WE DISCOVER RAILLY, six years older now, standing at a lecternin a pool of light.  Shes dwarfed by the giant screen where theengraving is replaced by a series of slides of woodcuts showingscenes of pestilence in the Middle Ages as she lectures to anaudience of mostly SCHOLARLY TYPES.RAILLY (cont.)In 1841, Mackay wrote, \"During seasonsof great pestilence, men have oftenbelieved the prophecies of crazedfanatics, that the end of the world wascome.\"  Obviously, this plague/doomsdayscenario is considerably more compellingwhen reality supports it in some form,whether its the Bubonic Plague, smallpox,or AIDS.  In addition to these \"natural\"contagions, there are now technologicalhorrors as well:  besides radiation,consider our lurking fear of germwarfare and its close approximation,chemical warfare, which first rearedits ugly head in the deadly mustardgas attacks during the First World War.ON THE SCREEN, a SERIES of SLIDES show images of WORLD WAR ISOLDIERS in gas masks, in death throes, etc..RAILLYS VOICE (cont. o.s.)During such an attack in the Frenchtrenches in October, 1917, we have anaccount of this soldier...ON THE SCREEN, a slide of an old deteriorated photograph showsJOSE, the Puerto Rican kid, strapped to a stretcher, being carriedby SOLDIERS through the trenches during an attack.  JOSE appearsto be ranting madly as the projector ZOOMS CLOSER on his face untilthe image approximates Munchs famous painting.RAILLYS VOICE (cant. o.s.)-- who, during an assault, was woundedby shrapnel and hospitalized behind thelines where Doctors discovered he hadlost all comprehension of French butspoke English fluently, albeit in aregional dialect they didnt recognize.The man, although physically unaffectedby the gas, was hysterical.  He claimedhe had come from the future, that he waslooking for a pure germ that wouldultimately wipe mankind off the face ofthe earth in the year... 1995!The AUDIENCE gives a nervous CHUCKLE.ON THE SCREEN, a different old photograph of JOSE.  This timehes in a military hospital, gaunt, haunted, very ill.RAILLYS VOICE (cont. o.s.)Although seriously injured, the youngsoldier disappeared from the hospitalbefore more data could be gathered.  Nodoubt, he was trying to carry on hismission to warn others, substitutingfor the agony of war...a self-inflictedagony we call the \"Cassandra Complex\".As RAILLY continues, we SCAN the AUDIENCE and DISCOVER MARILOU MARTIN,RAILLYS friend, and MARILOUS HUSBAND, WAYNE CHANG, both listeningattentively.  Further away, another MAN listens intently.  A MAN withshoulder-length carrot-colored hair.  His name is DR. PETERS.RAILLY (cont.)Cassandra, in Greek legend you will recall,was condemned to know the future but to bedisbelieved when she foretold it.  Hence,the agony of foreknowledge combined withimpotence to do anything about it.INT.  RECEPTION ROOM - AN HOUR LATER (NIGHT)A stack of new books.  THE DOOMSDAY SYNDROME, ApocalypticVisions of the Mentally Ill by Dr. Kathryn RaillySurrounded by enthusiastic members of the audience, RAILLY isseated at the table signing books but DR. PETERS has her ear.DR. PETERSI think, Dr. Railly, you have givenyour alarmists a bad name.  Surelythere is very real and very convincingdata that the planet cannot survive theexcesses of the human race:  proliferationof atomic devices, uncontrolled breedinghabits, the rape of the environment, thepollution of land, sea, and air.  In thiscontext, isnt it obvious that \"ChickenLittle\" represents the sane vision andthat Homo Sapiens motto, \"Lets goshopping!\" is the cry of the true lunatic?DR. PETERS smiles self-importantly at RAILLY as an elderlydisheveled PROFESSOR elbows in front of him. DISHEVELED PROFESSORDoctor Railly -- please!  I wonder ifyoure aware of my own studies whichindicate that certain cycles of themoon actually impact on the incidenceof apocalyptic predictions as observedin urban emergency rooms and...As the PROFESSOR babbles, MARILOU MARTIN and her husband, WAYNECHANG, appear and whisper...MARILOUYou were great.RAILLYYoure leaving?MARILOUThe reservations at nine thirty --its getting late.DISHEVELED PROFESSORDoctor Railly -- please -- this is veryimportant!WAYNE CHANG(checking the professor)You sure youre gonna be all right?RAILLY(smiles, checks her watch)Ill be there in twenty minutes.DISHEVELED PROFESSORDr. Railly, I simply cannot understandyour exclusion of the moon in relationto apocalyptic dementia...EXT.  PARKING LOT/BREITROSE HALL - NIGHTA full moon.COLLEAGUES in a VOLVO pull out of the parking lot, calling,\"Congratulations\" to RAILLY.She waves back as she hurries to her black ACURA, one of the lastcars left in the lot.The outside lights of Breitrose Hall go off.RAILLY seems to be alone in the lot as she fishes keys from herpurse, unlocks her car door, starts to open it when...Suddenly, shes grabbed from behind in a choke-hold by a largeshadowy MAN looming out of the darkness behind her.MANS VOICEGet in!Unable to scream, she writhes and kicks as he forces her into thefront seat.MANS VOICEIve got a gun.RAILLY freezes, terrified, as he opens the rear door andscrambles in behind her.INT.

ACURA/PARKING LOTThe engine STARTS, the Acura backs up, then heads for the exit.INT.  ACURASteering fearfully, RAILLY hears him speak more calmly now.MANS VOICE (o.s.)I dont want to hurt you.  But I will.Ive hurt people before when...when Ihad no choice.  Turn left.As she makes the turn, RAILLY glances in the rear view mirror,sees him unfolding a tattered map.  His face is lost in darknessbut she glimpses ragged, torn clothing as he tries to read themap by the intermittent glow of passing street lights.RAILLYWhere... where are we goingMANI need you to drive me to Philadelphia.RAILLY(startled, horrified)But thats... thats more than 200 miles!MANThats why I cant walk there.  Turnhere... I think...RAILLY obeys.  She glances in the mirror again, hesitates, thenboldly switches on the dome light, holding her breath fearfullyfor his reaction.He grunts appreciatively.  Relieved, she looks in the mirroragain, trying to get a better look at him, but now his featuresare concealed by the map.RAILLYIf you make me go with you, itskidnapping.  Thats a serious crime.If you let me go, you could just takethe car and...MANI dont know how to drive!  We wentunderground when I was nine, I told youthat.  When you come to the corner,turn right.Startled, RAILLY whirls, looks right at him.Hes lowered the map.  Its COLE!  Haggard, unshaven, dirty.RAILLYCole!  James Cole!  You escaped from alocked room six years ago.COLE1989.  Six years for you.  Theres thesign!  Right here!COLE is indicating a freeway entrance.RAILLY turns the wheel sharply.EXT.

I know thisisnt what you meant, but...I was desperate...no money...bum leg... sleeping on the streets.I probably smell bad.  Sorry about that.But then I saw your book in a store windowwith a notice about your lecture.(sudden pride)I can read, remember?RAILLYYes, I remember.(a beat, then)Why do you want to go to Philadelphia?COLEIts the next step.  I checked out theBaltimore information, it was nothing.Its Philadelphia, thats where theyare, the ones who killed everyone.(pointing suddenly, eagerly)Zs that a radio?  Does it play music?RAILLY turns on the radio and immediately WE HEAR the SOUND of SURFand the CRIES of gulls, background to an oozing baritone COMMERCIAL.COMMERCIAL/RADIO (o.s.)This is a personal message to you.COLE sits up, alert, listening intently.COMMERCIAL/RADIO (cont. o.s.)Are you at the end of your rope?  Areyou dying to get away?COLES eyes narrow, concentrating on this personal message.COMMERCAIL/RADIO (cont. o.s.}The Florida Keys are waiting for you.COLE frowns as the SOUND of breaking SURF and crying GULLS fillsthe car.  Its confusing!  He blurts out...COLEIve never seen the ocean!Observing his confusion in the mirror, RAILLY assumes herprofessional tone.RAILLYIts an advertisement, Mr. Cole.  Youdo understand that, dont you?  Itsnot really a special message to you.COLE frowns.  He did think it was for him, but shes probably right.COLEYou used to call me \"James\".RAILLYYoud prefer that? ... James...youdont really have a gun, do you.COLE(cynical laugh)Everybodys got a gun.

       "'        2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY    Screenplay   by    Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clark    Hawk Films Ltd.,    c/o. M-G-M Studios,    Boreham Wood,    Herts.TITLE    PART I    AFRICA    3,000,000 YEARS AGOA1VIEWS OF AFRICAN DRYLANDS - DROUGHTThe remorseless drought had lasted now for ten million years,and would not end for another million. The reign of the ter-rible lizards had long since passed, but here on the continentwhich would one day be known as Africa, the battle for survivalhad reached a new climax of ferocity, and the victor was notyet in sight. In this dry and barren land, only the small orthe swift or the fierce could flourish, or even hope to exist. a1A2INT & EXT CAVES - MOONWATCHERThe man-apes of the field had none of these attributes, andthey were on the long, pathetic road to racial extinction.About twenty of them occupied a group of caves overlookinga small, parched valley, divided by a sluggish, brown stream.The tribe had always been hungry, and now it was starving.As the first dim glow of dawn creeps into the cave, Moonwatcherdiscovers that his father has died during the night. He did not knowthe Old One was his father, for such a relationship was beyondhis understanding. but as he stands looking down at the emac-iated body he feels something, something akin to sadness. Thenhe carries his dead father out of the cave, and leaves him for thehyenas.Among his kind, Moonwatcher is almost a giant. He is nearlyfive feet high, and though badly undernourished, weighs overa hundred pounds. His hairy, muscular body is quite man-like,and his head is already nearer man than ape. The forehead islow, and there are great ridges over the eye-sockets, yet heunmistakably holds in his genes the promise of humanity. Ashe looks out now upon the hostile world, there is already a2A2CONTINUEDsomething in his gaze beyond the grasp of any ape. In thosedark, deep-set eyes is a dawning awareness-the first intima-tions of an intelligence which would not fulfill itself for anothertwo million years. a3A3EXT  THE STREAM - THE OTHERSAs the dawn sky brightens, Moonwatcher and his tribe reachthe shallow stream.The Others are already there. They were there on the otherside every day - that did not make it any less annoying.There are eighteen of them, and it is impossible to distinguishthem from the members of Moonwatchers own tribe. Asthey see him coming, the Others begin to angrily dance andshriek on their side of the stream, and his own people replyIn kind.The confrontation lasts a few minutes - then the display diesout as quickly as it has begun, and everyone drinks his fill ofthe muddy water. Honor has been satisfied - each group hasstaked its claim to its own territory. a4A4EXT  AFRICAN PLAIN - HERBIVORESMoonwatcher and his companions search for berries, fruitand leaves, and fight off pangs of hunger, while all aroundthem, competing with them for the samr fodder, is a potentialsource of more food than they could ever hope to eat. Yetall the thousands of tons of meat roaming over the parchedsavanna and through the brush is not only beyond their reach;the idea of eating it is beyond their imagination. They areslowly starving to death in the midst of plenty. a5A5EXT  PARCHED COUNTRYSIDE - THE LIONThe tribe slowly wanders across the bare, flat country-side foraging for roots and occasional berries.Eight of them are irregularly strung out on the open plain,about fifty feet apart.The ground is flat for miles around.Suddenly, Moonwatcher becomes aware of a lion, stalkingthem about 300 yards away.Defenceless and with nowhere to hide, they scatter in alldirections, but the lion brings one to the ground. a6A6EXT  DEAD TREE - FINDS HONEYIt had not been a good day, though as Moonwatcher had noreal remembrance of the past he could not compare one daywith another. But on the way back to the caves he finds ahive of bees in the stump of a dead tree, and so enjoys thefinest delicacy his people could ever know. Of course, healso collects a good many stings, but he scacely noticesthem. He is now as near to contentment as he is everlikely to be; for thought he is still hungry, he is not actuallyweak with hunger. That was the most that any hominid couldhope for. a7A7INT & EXT  CAVES - NIGHT TERRORSOver the valley, a full moon rises, and a cold wind blows downfrom the distant mountains. It would be very cold tonight -but cold, like hunger, was not a matter for any real concern;it was merely part of the background of life.This Little Sun, that only shone at night and gave no warmth,was dangerous; there would be enemies abroad. Moonwatchercrawls out of the cave, clambers on to a large boulder besidesthe entrance, and squats there where he can survey the valley.If any hunting beast approached, he would have time to get backto the relative safety of the cave.Of all the creatures who had ever lived on Earth, Moonwatchersrace was the first to raise their eyes with interest to the Moon,and though he could not remember it, when he was young,Moonwatcher would reach out and try to touch its ghostly face.Now he new he would have to find a tree that was highenough.He stirs when shrieks and screams echo up the slope fromone of the lower caves, and he does not need to hear the a8A7CONTINUEDoccasional growl of the lion to know what is happening. Downthere in the darkness, old One-Eye and his family are dying,and the thought that he might help in some way never crossesMoonwatchers mind. The harsh logic of survival rules outsuch fancies. Every cave is silent, lest it attract disaster.And in the caves, in tortured spells of fitful dozing andfearful waiting, were gathered the nightmares of generationsyet to come. a9A8EXT  THE STREAM - INVASIONThe Others are growing desperate; the forage on their side ofthe valley is almost exhausted. Perhaps they realise thatMoonwatchers tribe has lost three of its numbers during thenight, for they choose this mourning to break the truce. Whenthey meet at the river in the still, misty dawn, there is adeeper and more menacing note in their challenge. The noisybut usually harmless confrontation lasts only a few secondsbefore the invasion begins.In an uncertainly-moving horde, the Others cross the river,shieking threats and hunched for the attack. They are ledby a big-toothed hominid of Moonwatchers own size and age.Startled and frightened, the tribe retreats before the firstadvance, throwing nothing more substantial than imprecationsat the invaders. Moonwatcher moves with them, his mind amist of rage and confusion. To be driven from their ownterritory is a great badness, but to lose the river is death.He does not know what to do; it is a situation beyond hisexperience.Then he becomes dimly aware that the Others are slowing a10A8CONTINUEDdown, and advancing with obvious reluctance. The further theymove from their own side, the more uncertain and unhappythey become. Only Big-Tooth still retains any of his originaldrive, and he is rapidly being seperated from his followers.As he sees this, Moonwatchers own morale immediatelyrevives. He slows down his retreat, and begins to makereassuring noises to his companions. Novel sensations fillhis dim mind - the first faint precursors of bravery andleadership.Before he realizes it, he is face to face with Big-Tooth, andthe two tribes come to a halt many paces away.The disorganized and unscientific conflict could have endedquickly if either had used his fist as a club, but thisinnovation still lay hundreds of thousands of years in thefuture. Instead, the slowly weakening fighters claw andscratch and try to bite each other.Rolling over and over, they come to a patch of stony ground,and when they reach it Moonwatcher is on top. By chance, a11A8CONTINUEDhe chooses this moment to grab the hair on Big-Tooths scalp,and bang his head on the ground. The resulting CRACK isso satisfactory, and produces such an immediate weakeningIn Big - Tooths resistance, that he quickly repeats it.Even when Big-Tooth ceases to move for some time, Moon-watcher keeps up the exhilirating game.With shrieks of panic, the Others retreat back, across thestream. The defenders cautiously pursue them as far asThe waters edge. a12EXT  CAVE - NEW SOUNDDozing fitfully and weakened by his stuggle, Moonwatcher isstartled by a sound.He sits up in the fetid darkness of the cave, straining hissenses out into the night, and fear creeps slowly into his soul.Never in his life - already twice as long as most members ofhis species could expect - has he heard a sound like this. Thegreat cats approached in silence, and the only thing thatbetrayed them was a rare slide of earth, or the occasionalcracking of a twig. Yet this is a continuing crunching noisethat grows steadily louder. It seemed that some enormousbeast was moving through the night, making no attempt atconcealment, and ignoring all obstacles.And then there came a sound which Moonwatcher could notpossibly have identified, for it had never been heard beforein the history of this planet. a13A10EXT CAVE - NEW ROCKMoonwatcher comes face to face with the New Rock when heleads the tribe down to the river in the first light of morning.He had almost forgotten the terror of the night, because nothinghad happened after that initial noise, so he does not evenassociate this strange thing with danger or with fear. Thereis nothing in the least alarming about it.It is a cube about fifteen feet on a side, and it is made ofsome completely transparent material; indeed, it is not easyto see except when the light of the sun glints on its edges.There are no natural objects to which Moonwatcher cancompare this apparition. Though he is wisely cautiousof most new things, he does not hesitate to walk up to it.As nothing happens, he puts out his hand, and feels a warm,hard surface.After several minutes of intense thought, he arrives at abrilliant explanation. It is a rock, of course, and itmust have grown during the night. There are many plantsthat do this - white, pulpy things shaped like pebbles, thatseem to shoot up in the hours of darkness. It is true thatthey are small and round, whereas this is large and square; a14A10CONTINUEDbut greater and later philosophers than Moonwatcher would beprepared to overlook equally striking exceptions to their laws.This really superb piece of abstract thinking leads Moonwatcherto a deduction which he immediately puts to the test. The white,round pebble-plants are very tasty (though there were a fewthat made one violently sick); perhaps this square one...?A few licks and attempted nibbles quickly disillusion him.There is no nourishment here; so like a sensible hominid, hecontinues on his way to the river and forgets all about the Cube. a15A11EXT CUBE - FIRST LESSONThey are still a hundred yards from the New Rock when thesound begins.It is quite soft, and it stops them in their tracks, so that theystand paralyzed on the trail with their jaws hanging. A simple,maddeningly repetitious rhythm pulses out of the crystal cubeand hypnotises all who come within its spell. For the firsttime - and the last, for two million year - the sound ofdrumming is heard in Africa.The throbbing grows louder, more insistent. Presently thehominids begin to move forward like sleep-walkers, towardsthe source of that magnetic sound. Sometimes they take littledancing steps, as their blood responds to the rhythms thattheir descendants will not create for ages yet.Totally entranced, they gather around the Cube, forgettingthe hardships of the day, the perils of the approaching dusk,and the hunger in their bellies.Now, spinning wheels of light begin to merge, and the spokesfuse into luminous bars that slowly recede into the distance, a16A11CONTINUEDrotating on their axes as they do; and the hominids watch, wide-eyed, mesmerized captives of the Crystal Cube.Then by some magic - though it was no more magical than allthat had gone on before - a perfectly normal scene appears. Itis as if a cubical block had been carved out of the day andshifted into the night. Inside that block is a group of fourhominids, who might have been members of Moonwatchersown tribe, eating chunks of meat. The carcass of a wart-hoglies near them.This little family of male and female and two children is gorgedand replete, with sleek and glossy pelts - and this was acondition of life that Moonwatcher had never imagined. Fromtime to time they stir lazily, as they loll at ease near theentrance of their cave, apparently at peace with the world.The spectacle of domestic bliss merges into a totallydifferent scene.The family is no longer reposing peacefully outside its cave;it is foraging, searching for food like any normal hominids. a17A11CONTINUEDA small wart-hog ambles past the group of browsing humanoidswithout giving them more than a glance, for they had never beenthe slightest danger to its species.But that happy state of affairs is about to end. The big malesuddenly bends down, picks up a heavy stone lying at his feet -and hurls it upon the unfortunate pig. The stone descends uponits skull, making exactly the same noise that Moonwatcher hadproduced in his now almost forgotten encounter with Big-Tooth.And the result, too, is much the same - the warthog gives oneamazed, indignant squeal, and collapses in a motionless heap.Then the whole sequence begins again, but this time it unfoldsitself with incredible slowness. Every detail of the movementcan be followed; the stone arches leisurely through the air, thepig crumples up and sinks to the ground. There the scenefreezes for long moments, the slayer standing motionlessabove the slain, the first of all weapons in his hand.The scene suddenly fades out. The cube is no more than aglimmering outline in the darkness; the hominids stir, as if a18A11CONTINUEDawakening from a dream, realise where they are, and scuttleback to their caves.They have no concious memory of what they had seen; but thatnight, as he sits brooding at the entrance of his lair, his earsattuned to the noises of the world around him, Moonwatcherfeels the first faint twinges of a new and potent emotion - the urgeto kill. He had taken his first step towards humanity. a19A12EXT cave AND PLAINS - UtopiaBabies were born and sometimes lived; feeble, toothless thirty-year-olds died; the lion took its toll in the night; the Othersthreatened daily across the river - and the trib prospered.In the course of a single year, Moonwatcher and his companionshad changed almost beyond recognition.They had become as plump as the family in the Cave, who nolonger haunted their dreams. They had learned their lessonswell; now they could handle all the stone tools and weapons thatthe Cube had revealed to them.They were no longer half-numbed with starvation, and theyhad time both for leisure and for the first rudiments of thought.Their new way of life was casually accepted, and they didnot associate it in any way with the crystal cube still standingoutside their cave.But no Utopia is perfect, and this one had two blemishes. Thefirst was the marauding lion, whose passion for hominidsseemed to have grown even stronger now that they were betternourished. The second was the tribe across the river; for a20A12CONTINUEDsomehow the Others had survived, and had stubbornly refused todie of starvation. a21A13EXT CAVES - KILLING THE LIONWith the partly devoured carcass of a warthog laid out on theground at the point he hope the boulder would impact, Moon-watcher and three of his bravest companions wait for twoconsecutive nights. On the third the lion comes,betraying his presences by a small pebble slide.When they can here the lion below, softly tearing at the meat,they strain themselves against the massive boulder. The soundof the lion stops; he is listening. Again they silently heaveagainst the enormous stone, exerting the final limits of theirstrength. The rock begin to tip to a new balance point.The lion twitches alert to this sound, but having no fear of thesecreatures, he makes the first of two mistakes which will costhim his life; he goes back to his meal.The rock moves slowly over the ledge, picking up speed withamazing suddeness. It strikes a projection in the cliff aboutfifteen feet above the ground, which deflects its path outward.Just at this instant, the lion reacts instinctively and leapsaway from the face of the cliff directly into the path of the a22A13CONTINUEDonrushing boulder. He has combined the errors of over-confidence and bad luck.The next morning they find the lion in front of the cave. Theyalso find one of their tribe who had incautiously peeped out tosee what was happening, and was apparently killed by a smallrock torn loose by the boulder; but this was a small price topay for such a great victory.  * * * * * * * *And then one night the crystal cube was gone, and not evenMoonwatcher ever thought of it again. He was still whollyunaware of all that it had done. a23A14EXT STREAM - MASTER OF THE WORLDFrom their side of the stream, in the never violated safety oftheir own territory, the Others see Moonwatcher and fourteenmales of his tribe appear from behind a small hillock over-looking the stream, silhouetted against the dawn sky.The Others begin to scream their daily challenge. But todaysomething is different, though the Others do not immediatlyrecognize this fact.Instead of joining the verbal onslaught, as they had always done,Moonwatcher and his small band decended from the rise, andbegin to move forward to the stream with a quiet purposefulnessnever befor seen.As the Others watch the figures silently approaching in themorning mist, they become aware of the terrible strangnessof this encounter, and their rage gradually subsides down toan uneasy silence.At the waters edge, Moonwatcher and his band stop. Theycarry their bone clubs and bone knives. a24A14CONTINUEDLed by One-ear, the Others half-heartly resume the battle-chant. But they are suddenly confrunted with a vision that cutsthe sound from their throats, and strikes terror into theirhearts.Moonwatcher, who had been partly concealed by two males whowalked before him, thrusts his arm high into the air. In hishand he holds a stoud tree branch. Mounted atop the branch isthe bloody head of the lion, its mouth jammed open with a stick,displaying its frightful fangs.The Others gape in fearful disbelief at this display of power.Moonwatchers stands motionless, thrusting the lions head high.Then with majestic deliberation, still carrying his mangledstandard above his head, he begins to cross the stream, followedby his band.The Others fade back from the stream, seeming to lack eventhe ability to flee.Moonwatcher steps ashore and walks to One-Ear, who stands a25A14CONTINUEDunsurely in front of his band.Though he is a veteran of numerous combats at the waters edge,One-Ear has never been attacked by an enemy who had not firstdisplayed his fighting rage; and he had never before been attackedwith a weapon. One-Ear, merely looks up at the raised clubuntil the heavey thigh bone of an antelope brings the darknessdown around him.The Others stare in wonder at Moonwatchers power.Moonwatcher surveys the scene. Now he was master of theworld, and he was not sure what to do next. But he wouldthink of something. a26    A SECTION TIMING    A1    00.30    A2    00.45    A3    01.30    A4    00.30    A5    01.00    A6    01.00    A7    01.00    A8    03.00    A9    00.45    A10   02.00    A11   04.00    A12   02.00    A13   02.30    A14   02.30    A SECTION TOTAL: @23 MIN. 00 SECS     TITLEPART II    YEAR 2001    a26a B1EARTH FROM 200 MILES UP NARRATOR    By the year 2001, overpopulation hasB1a replaced the problem of starvationTHOUSAND MEGATON   but this was ominously offset by theNUCLEAR BOMB IN ORBIT   absolute and utter perfection of theABOVE THE EARTH,   weapon.RUSSIAN INSIGNIA ANDCCCP MARKINGSB1b NARRATORAMERICAN THOUSAND  Hundreds of giant bombs had beenMEGATON BOMB IN ORBIT   placed in perpetual orbit above theABOVE THE EARTH.

FLOYD    Im sorry, but Im not sure    I know what you mean.    SMYSLOV    Well, its just for the past    two weeks there have been    some extremely odd things    happening at Clavius.    FLOYD    Really?    SMYSLOV    Yes. Well, for one thing,    whenever you phone the base,    all you can get is a recording    which repeats that the phone    lines are temporarily out of    order.12/7/65  b32 B20CONTINUED    FLOYD    Well, I suppose theyve been    having a bit of trouble with    some of the equipment.    SMYSLOV    Yes, well at first we thought    that was the explanation, but    its been going on for the past    ten days.    FLOYD    You mean you havent been able    to get anyone at the base for ten    days?    SMYSLOV    Thats right.    FLOYD    I see.

ELENA    Clavius Control came on the    air just long enough to transmit    their refusal.    FLOYD    Well, that does sound very odd.    SMYSLOV    Yes, and Im afaid theres    going to be a bit of a row about    it. Denying the men permission    to land was a direct violation of    the I.A.S. convention.    FLOYD    Yes...

SMYSLOV    Quite frankly, we have had some    very reliable intelligence reports    that a quite serious epidemic    has broken out at Clavius.    Something, apperently, of an    unknown origin.

I can understand and sympathize    with your negative views. I have    been personally embarrassed by    this cover story. But I fully    accept the need for absolute    secrecy and I hope you will.    It should not be difficult for all    of you to realise the potential for    cutural shock and social    disorientation contained in the    present situation if the facts    were prematurely and suddenly    made public without adequate    preparation and conditioning.11/25/65 b55 B38CONTINUED    FLOYD    This is the view of the Council    and the purpose of my visit here    is to gather addition facts and    opinions on the situation and to    prepare a report to the Council    recommending when and how the    news should eventually be    announced. Are there any    questions?    MICHAELS    Dr. Floyd, how long do you think    this can be kept under wraps?    FLOYD    (pleasantly)    Im afraid it can and it will be    kept under wraps as long as it    is deemed to be necessary by    the Council. And of course you    know that the Council has requested    that formal security oaths are to    be obtained in writing from every-    one who had any knowledge of this    event. There must be adequate    time for a full study to be made    of the situation before any con-    sideration can be given to    making a public announcement.11/25/65 b56 B38CONTINUED    HALVORSEN    We will, of course, cooperate    in any way possible, Dr. Floyd.11/25/65 b56a B39SEVERAL SCENIC VIEWS OFMOON ROCKET BUS SKIMMINGOVER SURFACE OF MOON.10/5/65  b57 B40INSIDE ROCKET BUS,FLOYD, HALVORSEN,MICHAELS, FOURTHMAN, PILOT ANDCO-PILOT.

The sub-surface    structure shows that it was    deliberately buried about four    million years ago.    FLOYD    How can you tell it was    deliberately buried?    MICHAELS    By the deformation between    the mother rock and the fill.    FLOYD    Any clue as to what it is?    MICHAELS    Not really. Its completely    inert. No sound or energy    sources have been detected.    The surface is made of    something incredibly hard    and weve been barely able    to scratch it.

HALVORSEN    The only thing about it that we are    sure of is that it is the first direct    evidence of intelligent life beyond    the Earth.SILENT APPRECIATION    HALVORSEN    Four million years ago, something,    presumably from the stars, must    have swept through the solar    system and left this behind.11/25/65 b64 B44CONTINUED    FLOYD    Was it abandoned, forgotten, left    for a purpose?    HALVORSEN    I suppose well never know.    MICHAELS    The moon would have made an    excellent base camp for    preliminary Earth surveys.SOME MORE SILENCE    FLOYD    Any ideas about the colour?    MICHAELS    Well, not really. At first glance,    black would suggest something    sun-powered, but then why would    anyone deliberately bury a sun-    powered device?    FLOYD    Has it been exposed to any sun    before now?    MICHAELS    I dont think it has, but Id    like to check that.

NARRATOR    A hundred million miles beyond    Mars, in the cold lonliness    where no man had yet travelled,    Deep-Space-Monitor-79 drifts    slowly among the tangled orbits    of the asteroids.    NARRATOR    Radiation detectors noted and    analyzed incoming cosmic rays    from the galaxy and points beyond;    neutron and x-ray telescopes    kept watch on strange stars that    no human eye would eever see;    magnetometers observed the    gusts and hurricanes of the solar    winds, as the sun breathed million    mile-an-hour blasts of plasma    into the faces of its circling    children.    NARRATOR    All these things and many others    were patiently noted by Deep-    Space-Monitor-79, and recorded    in its crystalline memory.11/25/65 b68 B47CONTINUED    NARRATOR    But now it had noted something    strange - the faint yet    unmistakable distrubance rippling    across the solar system, and    quite unlike any natural phenomena    it had ever observed in the past.    NARRATOR    It was also observed by Orbiter    M-15, circling Mars twice a    day; and High Inclination Probe-    21, climbing slowly above the    planet of the ecliptic; and even    artificial Comet-5, heading out    into the cold wastes beyond    Pluto, along an orbit whose    far point it would not reach for    a thousand years.    NARRATOR    All noticed the peculiar burst of    energy that leaped from the face    of the Moon and moved across    the solar system, throwing off a    spray of radiation like the wake of    a racing speedboat.11/25/65 b69 B SECTION TIMINGB1-1f00.50B2500.10  B2   00.10B2600.20B3   00.15B2700.05B4   00.15B28OutB5   00.20B2900.30B6   00.15B3000.30B7   00.10B3100.25B8   00.15B3200.20B9   00.10B3300.20B10  00.10B3400.30B11  00.15B3500.20B12  00.50B3600.20B13  01.10B3700.30B14  00.35B3802.15B15  Out  B3900.20B16  Out  B4000.50B17  01.15B4100.15B18  00.15B4200.10B19  01.00B4300.15B20  03.55B4401.40B21  00.20B4500.20B21A 00.20B4600.40B21B 00.15B4701.25B22  01.00B23  00.10B24  01.30B SECTION TOTAL:  28 MIN. 10 SECS.TITLE    PART III    14 MONTHS LATER    b69aC1DISCOVERY 1,000,000MILES FROM EARTH.SEE EARTH AND MOONSMALL.WE SEE A BLINDINGFLASH EVERY 5SECONDS FROM ITSNUCLEAR PULSEPROPULSION.

POOLE    Dave, if youve a minute, Id like    your advice on something.    BOWMAN    Sure, what is it?    POOLE    Well, its nothing really important,    but its annoying.    BOWMAN    Whats up?    POOLE    Its about my salary cheques.    BOWMAN    Yes?    POOLE    Well I got the papers on my    official up-grading to AGS-19    two weeks before we left.12/14/65 c12 C12CONTINUED    BOWMAN    Yes, I remember you mentioning it.    I got mine about the same time.    POOLE    Thats right. Well, naturally,    I didnt say anything to Payroll.    I assumed theyd start paying me    at the higher grade on the next pay    cheque. But its been almost    three weeks now and Im still    being paid as an AGS-18.    BOWMAN    Interesting that you mention it,    because Ive got the same problem.    POOLE    Really.    BOWMAN    Yes.    POOLE    Yesterday, I finally called the    Accounting Office at Mission    Control, and all they could tell me    was that theyd received the AGS-19    notification for the other three but    not mine, and apparently not yours    either.12/14/65 c13 C12CONTINUED    BOWMAN    Did they have any explanation for    this?    POOLE    Not really. They just said it might    be because we trained at Houston and    they trained in Marshall, and that    were being charged against differ-    ent accounting offices.    BOWMAN    Its possible.    POOLE    Well, what do you think we ought    to do about it?    BOWMAN    I dont think we should make any    fuss about it yet. Im sure theyll    straighten it out.    POOLE    I must say, I never did understand    why they split us into two groups    for training.    BOWMAN    No. I never did, either.12/14/65 c14 C12CONTINUED    POOLE    We spent so little time with them,    I have trouble keeping their names    straight.    BOWMAN    I suppose the idea was specialized    training.    POOLE    I suppose so. Though, of course,    theres a more sinister explanation.    BOWMAN    Oh?    POOLE    Yes. You must have heard the    rumour that went around during    orbital check-out.    BOWMAN    No, as a matter of fact, I didnt.    POOLE    Oh, well, apparently theres    something about the mission that    the sleeping beauties know that    we dont know, and thats why we    were trained separately and    thats why they were put to sleep    before they were even taken aboard.12/14/65 c15 C12CONTINUED    BOWMAN    Well, what is it?    POOLE    I dont know. All I heard is that    theres something about the    mission we werent told.    BOWMAN    That seems very unlikely.    POOLE     Yes, I thought so.    BOWMAN    Of course, it would be very easy    for us to find out now.    POOLE    How?    BOWMAN    Just ask Hal. Its conceivable    they might keep something from    us, but theyd never keep anything    from Hal.    POOLE    Thats true.12/14/65 c15a C12   CONINUED    BOWMAN    (sighs)  Well... its silly, but...    if you want to, why dont you?POOLE WALKS TO THEHAL 9000 COMPUTER    POOLE    Hal... Dave and I believe that    theres something about the    mission that we werent told.    Something that the rest of the    crew know and that you know.    Wed like to know whether this    is true.    HAL    Im sorry, Frank, but I dont    think I can answer that question    without knowing everything that    all of you know.    BOWMAN    Hes got a point.    POOLE    Okay, then how do we re-phrase    the question?12/14/65 c15c  C12 CONTINUED    BOWMAN    Still, you really dont believe it,    do you?    POOLE    Not really. Though, it is strange    when you think about it. It didnt    really make any sense to keep    us apart during training.    BOWMAN    Yes, but its to fantastic to think    that theyd keep something from us.    POOLE    I know. It would be almost    inconceivable.    BOWMAN    But not completely inconceivable?    POOLE    I suppose it isnt logically impossible.    BOWMAN    I guess it isnt.    POOLE    Still, all we have to do is ask Hal.12/14/65 c15b C12CONTINUED    BOWMAN    Well, the only important aspect of    the mission are: where are we    going, what will we do when we    get there, when are we coming    back, and... why are we going?    POOLE    Right. Hal, tell me whether the    following statements are true or    false.    HAL    I will if I can, Frank.    POOLE    Our Mission Profile calls for    Discovery going to Saturn.    True or false?    HAL    True.    POOLE    Our transit time is 257 days. Is    that true?    HAL    Thats true.12/14/65 c15d C12CONTINUED    POOLE    At the end of a hundred days of    exploration, we will all go into     hibernation. Is this true?    HAL    Thats true.    POOLE    Approximately five years after we    go into hibernation, the recovery    vehicle will make rendezous with    us and bring us back. Is this true?    HAL    Thats true    POOLE    There is no other purpose for this    mission than to carry out a    continuation of the space program,    and to further our general    knowledge of the planets. Is that    true?    HAL    Thats true.    POOLE    Thank you very much, Hal.12/14/65 c15e C12CONTINUED    HAL    I hope Ive been able to be of    some help.BOTH MEN LOOK ATEACH OTHER RATHERSHEEPISHLY.12/14/65 c15f C13DISCOVERY IN SPACE.PULSING ALONG.EARTH AND MOON.11/19/65 c16 C14DELETEDC15DELETEDC15DELETEDC16DELETEDPAGES c17 - c41 DELETED C17DOCUMENTARY SEQUENCEILLUSTRATING THEFOLLOWING ACTIVITIES.SPLIT SCREEN TECHNIQUEAND SUPERIMPOSED CLOCKTO GIVE SENSE OFSIMULTANEOUS ACTION ANDTHE FEELING OF A TYPICALDAY.IN THE COURSE OF THESEACTIVITIES WE SHALL SEETHE COMPUTER USED INALL OF ITS FUNCTIONS.

First of all,    there is still a chance that he    is right, despite your tests,    and if it should happen again,    we suggest eliminating this    possibility by allowing the unit    to remain in place and seeing    whether or not it actually fails.    If the computer should turn out    to be wrong, the situation is    still not alarming. The type    of obsessional error he may be    guilty of is not unknown among    the latest generation of HAL    9000 computers.    It has almost always revolved    around a single detail, such as    the one you have described, and    it has never interfered with the    integrity or reliability of the    computers performance in    other areas.    No one is certain of the cause    of this kind of malfunctioning.    It may be over-programming,   (cont)12/1/65  c77 C72CONTINUED    MISSION CONTROL (cont)    but it could also be any number    of reasons.

HALS VOICE    That is true.    SIMONSON    Well, Im afaid Hal was lying.    He had been programmed to lie    about this one subject for secur-    ity reasons which well explain    later.    The true purpose of the Mission    was to have been explained to you    by Mission Commander Kaminsky,    on his revival. Hal knew this and    he knew the actual mission, but    he couldnt tell you the truth when    you challenged him. Under orders    (cont)12/13/65 c120 C148CONTINUED    SIMONSON (cont)    from earth he was forced to lie.    In everything except this he had    the usual reinforced truth program-    ming.    We believe his truth programming    and the instructions to lie,    gradually resulted in an    incompatible conflict, and    facedc with this dilemman, he    developed, for want of a better    description, neurotic symptoms.    Its not difficult to suppose that    these symptoms would centre on    the communication link with    Earth, for he may have blamed    us for his incompatible program-    ming.    Following this lin of thought, we    suspected that the last straw for him    was the possibility of disconnection.    Since he became operational, he had    never known unconsciousness. It    must have seemed the equivalent to    death.   (cont)12/13/65 c121C148CONTINUED    SIMONSON (cont)    At this point, he, presumably,    took whatever actions he thought    appropriate to protect himself    from what must have seemed to    him to be his human tormentors.    If I cane speak in human terms,    I dont think we can blame him    too much. We have ordered him    to disobey his conscience.    Well, thats it. Its very    speculative, but we think it is    a possible explanation. Anyway,    good luck on the rest of the     Mission and Im giving you back to    Bernard.C149CUT TO MISSION CONTROL.    MISSION CONTROL    Hello, Dave. Now, Im going to    play for you a pre-taped briefing    which had been stored in Hals    memory and would have been    played for you by Mission Com-    mmander Kaminsky, when he,  (cont)12/13/65 c122 C149CONTINUED    MISSION CONTROL (cont)    had been revived. The briefing is    by Doctor Heywood Floyd. Here it    is...12/13/65 c123C150FLOYDS RECORDEDBRIEFING    FLOYD    Good day, gentlemen. When you    see this briefing, I presume you    will be nearing your destination,    Saturn. I hope that youve had a    pleasant and uneventful trip and    that the rest of your mission    continues in the same manner. I    should like to fill you in on some    more of the details on which    Mission Commander Kaminsky    will have already briefed you.    Thirteen months before the launch    date of your Saturn mission, on    April 12th, 2001, the first evidence    for intelligent life outside the Earth    was discovered.    It was found buried at a depth of    fifteen metres in the crater Tycho.    No news of this was ever announced,    and the event had been kept    secret since then, for reasons which    I will later explain.    Soon after it was uncovered, it    emitted a powerful blast of (cont)12/13/65 c124 C150CONTINUED    FLOYD (cont)    radiation in the radio spectrum    which seems to have triggered    by the Lunar sunrise.    Luckily for those at the site, it    proved harmless.    Perhaps you can imagine our    astonishment when we later found    it was aimed precisely at Saturn.    A lot of thought went into the    question of wether or not it was    sun-triggered, as it seemed    illogical to deliberately bury a    sun-powered device.    Burying it could only shield it    from the sun, since its intense    magnetic field made it otherwise    easily detectable.    We finally concluded that the only    reason you might bury a sun-    powered device would be to keep    it inactive until it would be    uncovered, at which time it would    absorb sunlight and trigger itself. (cont)12/14/65 c125C150CONTINUED    FLOYD    What is its purpose?  I wish we    knew. The object was buried on    the moon about four million years    ago, when our ancestors were    primative man-apes.    Weve examined dozens of theories,    but the one that has the most    currency at the moment is that    the object serves as an alarm.    What the purpose of the alarm is,    why they wish to have the alarm,    whether the alarm represents    any danger to us?  These are    questions no one can answer.    The intentions of an alien world,    at least four million years older    than we are, cannot be reliably    predicted.    In view of this, the intelligence    and scientific communities felt    that any public announcment    might lead to significant cultural    shock and disorientation.    Discussion took place at the     highest levels between govern-    (cont)12/14/65 c126 C150CONTINUED    FLOYD (cont)    ments, and it was decided that the    only wise and precautionary    course to follow was to assume    that the intentions of this alien    world are potentially dangerous    to us, until we have evidence to    the contrary.    This is, of course, why security    has been maintained and why    this information has been kept    on a need-to-know basis.    And now I should like to show you    a TV monitor tape of the actual    signalling event.12/14/65 c127C151WE SEE A REPLAYOF THE TMA-1 RADIOEMISSION, AS SEENFROM A TV MONITORON THE SPOT.

But when they looked out across    the deeps of space, they felt    awe and wonder - and loneliness.    In their explorations, they    encountered life in many forms,    and watched on a thousand worlds    the workings of evolution.    They saw how often the first faint    sparks of intelligence flickered    and died in the cosmic night.    And because, in all the galaxy,    they had found nothing more    precious than Mind, they    encouraged its dawning every-    where.    The great Dinosaurs had long    since perished when their ships    entered the solar system, after    a voyage that had already lasted    thousands of years.12/9/65  d2D1CONTINUEDNARRATOR (cont)They swept past the frozen outerplanets, paused briefly above thedeserts of dying Mars andpresently looked down on Earth.For years they studied, collectedand catalogued.When they had learned all theycould, they began to modify.They tinkered with the destinyof many species on land and inthe ocean, but which of theirexperiments would succeedthey could not know for at leasta million years.They were patient, but they werenot yet immortal. There wasmuch to do in this Universe of ahundred billion stars. So theyset forth once more across theabyss, knowing that they wouldnever come this way again.Nor was there any need. Theirwonderful machines could betrusted to do the rest.  (cont)12/9/65  d3 D1CONTINUED    NARRATOR (cont)    On Earth, the glaciers came and    went, while above them, the    changeless Moon still carried its    secret.    With a yet slower rhythm than    the Polar ice, the tide of    civilization ebbed and flowed    across the galaxy.    Strange and beautiful and terrible    empires rose and fell, and passed    on their knowledge to their    successors.    Earth was not forgotten, but it was    one of a million silent worlds, a    few of which would ever speak.    Then the first explorers of Earth,    recognising the limitations of    their minds and bodies, passed    on their knowledge to the great    machines they had created, and    who now trnscended them in    every way.  (cont)12/9/65  d4D1CONTINUED    NARRATOR    For a few thousand years, they    shared their Universe with their    machine children; then, realizing    that it was folly to linger when    their task was done, they passed    into history without regret.    Not one of them ever looked through    his own eyes upon the planet Earth    again.    But even the age of the Machine    Entities passed swiftly. In their    ceaseless experimenting, they    had learned to store knowledge    in the structure of space itself,    and to preserve their thoughts    for eternity in frozen lattices    of light. They could become    creatures of radiation, free    at last from the tyranny of matter.    Now, they were Lords of the    galaxy, and beyond the reach    of time.    They could rove at will among the    stars, and sink like a subtle mist    through the very interstices of    space.12/9/65  d5 D1CONTINUED    NARRATOR (cont)    But despite their God-like powers,    they still watched over the    experiments their ancestors    had started so many generations    ago.    The companion of Saturn knew    nothing of this, as it orbited    in its no mans land between Mimas    and the outer edge of rings.    It had only to remember and wait,    and to look forever Sunward with    its strange senses.    For many weeks, it had watched    the approaching ship. Its long-    dead makers had prepared it for    many things and this was one of    them. And it recognised what    was climbing starward from the    Sun.    If it had been alive, it would have    felt excitement, but such an    emotion was irrelevant to its    great powers.   (cont)12/9/65  d6D1CONTINUED    NARRATOR (cont)    Even if the ship had passed it by,    it would not have known the    slightest trace of disappointment.    It had waited four million years;    it was prepared to wait for    eternity.    Presently, it felt the gentle touch    of radiations, trying to probe its    secrets.    Now, the ship was in orbit and it    began to speak, with prime    numbers from one to eleven,    over and over again.    Soon, these gave way to more    complex signals at many frequen-    cies, ultra-violet, infra-red,    X-rays.    The machine made no reply. It    had nothing to say.    Then it saw the first robot    probe, which descended and    hovered above the chasm.    (cont)12/9/65  d7 D1CONTINUED    NARRATOR (cont)    Then, it dropped into darkness.    The great machine knew that this    tiny scout was reporting back to    its parent; but it was too simple,    too primative a device to detect    the forces that were gathering    round it now.    Then the pod came, carrying    life. The great machine searched    its memories.    The logic circuits made their    decision when the pod had fallen    beyond the last faint glow of the    reflected Saturnian light.    In a moment of time, too short to    be measured, space turned and    twisted upon itself.12/9/65  d8 END OF SCREENPLAY   END OF FILE'"
